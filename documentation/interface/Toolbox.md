## Toolbox
The handy Toolbox sits inside the graph, giving you quick drag-drop access to all nodes, along with favorites and search. You can use the shortcut `TAB` while in the graph to quickly access the search function, which appears as a popup next to your mouse cursor.

## Search
Pressing `TAB` will show the Search popup. You can press `TAB` and start typing to get results. Pressing `Ctrl` + `1` through `9` will activate one of the first nine nodes in the search results.

## Recent
Recently used nodes will show up separately in the Search popup, giving you quicker access to frequently used nodes without having to explicitly set them as favorites.

The Recent nodes list is maintained per-session. It will be emptied when you exit Gaea.

## Using the Toolbox
You can drag and drop a node from the toolbox to your Graph surface. If you drop it on a node, it will automatically connect itself to that node's output.

See @Graph-Mode for more details on how to use the toolbox convenience features.

## Favorites
Favorite nodes are shown at the top of the Toolbox. To add or remove a node from favorites, right-click it in the Toolbox and click **Add/Remove Favorites**.

## Voice Commands

Voice Commands are an experimental feature.
