# Documentation

The documentation is organized to help you get started with Gaea quickly and easily regardless of your skill level.

# Getting Started

@Installing-Gaea contains instructions on installing Gaea.

If you are completely new to terrain design software, we recommend starting with the @Basics-of-Terrain-Design and familiarizing yourself with the Gaea Interface in @Getting-around.

Gaea champions the idea of having **multiple workflows** to suit the artist and the terrain. You choose how you want to work. You can even change your workflow in the middle of the project without adverse effects. The **Workflows** section explains the main workflows in Gaea: @Layers-Mode, @Graph-Mode, @Sculpt-Mode

The **Using Gaea** section explains various concepts in detail; including the @Build-Manager, @Color-Production, @Importing-Data, and more.

Refer to the @Node-Reference to learn about individual nodes, their functions, and usage advice.
