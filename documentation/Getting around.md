# Introduction to the User Interface

The Gaea user interface (UI) is made of 3 essential areas:
- The node graph where you construct your terrain using nodes.
- The properties panel where you change settings for the selected node.
- The viewport where you preview the terrain.

Certain aspects of the interface are altered depending on the workflow you have selected. The Node Graph is hidden when you work in @Layers-Mode. The @Toolbox is made visible when you work in @Graph-Mode.

See the following topics to get a better understanding of how Gaea operates:

- @Properties
- @Viewport
- @Resolutions
- @Toolbox
- @Preferences
- @shortcuts
- @Graph-Mode
