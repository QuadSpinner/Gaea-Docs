# Introduction to the User Interface

![](/images/ui/Graph-Full.png)

The Gaea interface is streamlined

## Interface Sections
![](/images/ui/Graph-Graph.jpg)
The Graph surface is where you construct your terrain using different nodes.

![](/images/ui/Graph-Toolbox.jpg)
The @toolbox is where all nodes are located. You can drag and drop a node to the Graph surface to create a node.

![](/images/ui/Graph-Properties.jpg)
The @properties panel is where you can modify the properties of the node selected on the Graph surface.

![](/images/ui/Graph-Viewport3D.jpg)
The 3D @viewport lets you explore the terrain in real time. It shows the output of the currently selected node.

The 2D @viewport provides an unbiased view of the terrain or mask output of the currently selected node.

![](/images/ui/Graph-Toolbar.jpg)
The main toolbar, including the Gaea menu, is where you can access file commands, viewport modes, and terrain options such as materials, terrain definition, atmosphere, and water surface display.

The Graph toolbar provides quick access to common node commands. Most of these commands are also available by right-clicking the nodes themselves.

![](/images/ui/Graph-Favorites.jpg)
The Favorites panel is a handy way to access your most used nodes without having to go to the @toolbox. You can right-click nodes in the Toolbox to add or remove them from favorites.

The Gaea interface is resolution independent. If you're working on a HiDPI display, you can scale the entire interface using the Zoom slider.



Certain aspects of the interface are altered depending on the workflow you have selected. The Node Graph is hidden when you work in @layers-mode. The @toolbox is made visible when you work in @graph-mode.

Each of these major elements is discussed in detail in the following topics:
- @properties
- @viewport
- @resolutions
- @toolbox
- @preferences
- @shortcuts
- @graph-Mode
- @layers-Mode
