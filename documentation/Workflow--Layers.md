# Layers Workflow
The Layers approach brings the power of Graph-based terrain design with the simple management of Photoshop-style layers.

You start with a single Primitive layer like Mountain and then add more on top of it, building slowly, layer upon layer. It is great for modest needs, experimentation, and even learning!
