Fluvial erosion is a "secondary" erosion. It is most useful when applied on top of an already eroded surface, or when you need light erosion where carving is more important than sedimentation.

| Setting         | Values         | Description                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Duration**    | 1 - 1000       | The number of erosion cycles to simulate. Usually 200 is sufficient.              |
| **Power**       | 2.00 - 600.00  | The strength of the erosion.                                                      |
| **Granularity** | 1.00 - 6000.00 | Whether debris should be fine like dust, or coarser like rocks and even boulders.|
| **BasLen**      | 1 - 60         | The sub-simulation length of each particle.                                       |
| **Radius**      | 1 - 100        | The area affected by each particle.                                               |
| **Random**      | 0 - 1000       | The randomness of each particle's motion.                                         |
| **Seed**        | 0 - 128000     | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process.                         |
