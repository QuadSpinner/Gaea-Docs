| **Method**   |
|              | *Level*     | Automatically levels the terrain where the heights are proportionately distributed between the highest and lowest points. |
|              | *Equalize*  | Equalizes the terrain where the heights are linearly distributed between the highest and lowest points.                  |
|              | *Gamma*     | Applies a Gamma-style height adjustment to the terrain.                                                                  |
| **Strength** | 0 - 100% | The strength of the applied levels method.                                                                               |



> [!TIP] 
> Level is recommended over Equalize in most situations, as the latter may make terrains look too bulky and remove delicate features in some cases.
