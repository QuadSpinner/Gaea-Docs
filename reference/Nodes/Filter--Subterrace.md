title: Subterrace

Subterrace creates overlapping terraces with large, rounded corners and gentle slopes. It works great by itself, or when combined with @Stratify.

| Setting        | Values      | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| **Amount**     | 0.00 - 1.00 | Low values produce very fine terraces; high values produce bigger, bulkier terraces. |
| **Dispersion** | 0.00 - 1.00 | How far the terrace formations should spread. |


> [!WARNING] 
> At high values, Subterrace may take quite a while to build.
