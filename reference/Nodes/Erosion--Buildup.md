title: Buildup

nBuildup is an inverse form of erosion. Instead of taking sediments away, like the drag of Hydraulic erosion, it adds crusting to convex edges of the terrain. 

All erosion features found in terrain design software focus almost exclusively on carving the terrain, which eventually results in a predictable model. Buildup conversely regenerates some of the lost mass, filling up the excessively carved and convex areas. This is quite useful for simulating ancient landscapes.
