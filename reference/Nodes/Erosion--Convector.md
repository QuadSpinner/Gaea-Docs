Convector is an exaggerated form of thermal erosion with a bit of tweaks thrown in for stylized output. It creates strong slopes and terraces at the same time, giving you a unique flavor of erosion.

The delicate terracing can be very useful as a base for the Erosion node. As you can see in the second screenshot, these terraces help mimic a big mountain — especially for snow accumulation purposes.
