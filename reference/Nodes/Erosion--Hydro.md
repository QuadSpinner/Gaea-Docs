Hydro creates waterflow erosion, such as rivers and ancient seabeds. It can be used in two forms: Lateral and Ventral

Lateral enhances your terrain  by providing a different method of eroding rocky river banks, and even underwater areas. While Ventral uses partially randomized, churning forces to erode the terrain, Lateral concentrates on following the flow and creating patterns based on how water flows over and around obstacles.

Ventral works with two sets of forces: the macro force and the micro force, both interweaving to use the shape of the terrain to drive the erosion. This erosion method uses horizontal flow mechanics unlike the hydraulicy erosion resulting in an output that speaks of flowing waters gently carving the terrain over thousands of year.

| :------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Power**      | 0.00 - 1.00 | Higher values cause larger, smoother shapes and decay fine details. Lower values preserve details but create slightly rougher curves. |
| **Multiplier** | 1 - 10      | Higher values will cause the erosion to erase smaller features in the terrain by creating stronger flows.                             |
