Hydro creates waterflow erosion, such as rivers and ancient seabeds. It can be used in two forms: Lateral and Ventral.

Lateral enhances the terrain by providing a different method of eroding rocky river banks, and even underwater areas. Lateral follows the water flow, creating patterns based on the flows over and around obstacles. 

Ventral uses partially randomized, churning forces to erode the terrain. It works with two sets of forces: macro and micro, which interweave to use the shape of the terrain to drive the erosion. This erosion method uses horizontal flow mechanics (unlike hydraulic erosion), resulting in a look that flowing waters gently carved in the terrain over thousands of year.

| :------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Power**      | 0.00 - 1.00 | Higher values cause larger, smoother shapes and decay fine details. Lower values preserve details but create slightly rougher curves. |
| **Multiplier** | 1 - 10      | Higher values cause the erosion to erase smaller features in the terrain by producing stronger flows.                             |
