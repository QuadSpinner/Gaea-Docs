Mountain is one of the most versatile primitives in Gaea. It uses a modulated Voronoi pattern and distortions to create realistic mountain shapes, ready for further modification and erosion.

For simple results, such as distance mountains that don't require much detail, you can create a Mountain primitive with a scale of your choice and add the Erosion node. This is the easiest way to create a lot of simple assets.
