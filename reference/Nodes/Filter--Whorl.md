uid: Whorl
title: Whorl
---

Whorl applies multiple vortex-like distortions across the terrain to create large scale warping. This can be very useful when creating massive landscapes and wanting to avoid a patterning in the noise, or for creating slightly surreal or alien landscapes.

| Setting    | Values      | Description                                               |
| :--------- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Whorls** | 3 - 150     | The number of whorls to add to the terrain.               |
| **Power**  | 0.00 - 3.00 | The strength of the distortion applied with each whorl.   |
| **Type**   |             |
|            | *Spin*      | Whorls appear as round, independent formations.           |
|            | *Stretch*   | Whorls appear as stretched, interconnected formations.    |
| **Seed**   | 0 - 128000  | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process. |


> [!TIP] 
> Whorl can be overpowering if used by itself. An effective way to tone down Whorl is to lower the Influence value in the Post Processing panel. See @Properties for details.
