# Build Manager

The Build Manager gives you easy access to crucial output preferences. It is accessed by clicking the **Build** button in the top toolbar.

The node grid shows you all the nodes marked for output. You can temporarily toggle a node by clicking the color circle in the top left corner of the node. This does not affect the build, only the output. This can be useful when you just want to see a few specific outputs, or you need to go back to rebuild an older project for selective output.

When a node has multiple outputs, such as the Erosion and Breaker nodes in this example, you can individually toggle which ports should be saved as files.
