## Understanding the Advanced Graph
The graph may look complicated, but follows a simple pattern. Each node represents a specific function, and has two types of "ports", namely Input ports and Output ports. These ports are used to connect one node to another to create a sequence of functions, which result in a terrain.

There are certain nodes which may not have all the port types

## Masking
Masking is a very important part of creating sophisticated terrains. By default, when you apply an effect or process on a terrain, it is applied uniformly across the entire surface. By using the Mask port, you can contain the effect into a specific area.

You can use any shape/terrain to mask a node, or you can draw it with Fluent Masking.

### Fluent Masking
Fluent Masking allows you to paint a mask on your terrain.

To create a Fluent Mask, click the Fluent Mask button in the node's `Properties toolbar`. This will enable the Fluent Mask mode, and give you a small masking toolbar to control the size and intensity of your brush stroke. 

You can paint on the terrain like you would in any paint program. Holding down the `ALT` key will erase the stroke.

Once you are finished, click the "End Masking" button in the toolbar to commit the mask.
