Hydro is a new erosion node that runs on the GeoGlyph Terrain Engine. Hydro works with two sets of forces: the macro force and the micro force, both interweaving to use the shape of the terrain to drive the erosion. This erosion method uses horizontal flow mechanics unlike the vertical sedimentary erosion iconic of World Machine resulting in an output that speaks of flowing waters gently carving the terrain over thousands of year.

RiverErosion further enhances your river creation by providing a different method of eroding rocky river banks, and even underwater areas. While Hydro uses partially randomized, churning forces to erode the terrain, RiverErosion concentrates on following the flow and creating patterns based on how water flows over and around obstacles.
