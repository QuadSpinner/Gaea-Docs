## Heavy Nodes
We have classified some nodes, such as Erosion, Fluvial, etc. as "Heavy" nodes — meaning, they can take a long time to process, and sometimes cannot be cancelled mid-process. Updating multiple settings on such a node can slow down or even freeze up the application.

When you modify a Heavy node, it will not update automatically. It will instead show an Apply button, which you can click when you have made your changes.
If you move away from the node, or select another node, changes will be applied automatically, so you won’t lose any modifications.

You can optionally turn on the manual node update for all nodes if you prefer, by turning off "Automatically apply Node Modifications" in the Preferences. If the setting is turned on, which is the default, only Heavy nodes will require manual updates.
