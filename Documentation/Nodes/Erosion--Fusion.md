Fusion is a hybrid of slope erosion, vertical terracing, and thermal erosion. It addresses the challenge of creating interesting slopes in steep areas. Fusion adapts thermal erosion by producing modular talus.

Fusion further adds slanted terracing to convey terrain folding and collapsed plates.

| Setting        | Values     | Description                                                                                      |
| :------------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Iterations** | 1 - 500    | The number of erosion iterations to perform on the terrain.                                      |
| **Talus**      | 6 - 89     | The angle at which erosion should begin.                                                         |
| **Deviation**  | 0 - 20     | The variation (+/-) to the Talus angle. This is great for creating non-uniform collapsed plates. |
| **Seed**       | 0 - 128000 | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process.                                        |
