uid: Mask
title: Mask
---


This node does not have any direct properties. You create the mask by drawing it in the Mask interface which is launched by the **Edit Mask** button in the properties panel.

`TODO: Image`

For drawing, you have two options: Draw and Erase. The brush size slider lets you change your brush size for either operation.

If the Input port is connected to another node, a 2D representation of that terrains is shown in the background as a guide. This is optional, as the Input port only provides a drawing guide and does not affect the actual mask.
