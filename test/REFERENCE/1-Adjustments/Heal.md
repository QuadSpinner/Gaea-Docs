The Heal node can reconstruct damaged, low res, or 8-bit data with 16-bit, high resolution fidelity. The Heal node can take quantized images with extreme banding of any shape, and clean up the terrain into a naturalistic output.

Heal can consume 8-bit data, (visually) damaged images, or low quality satellite data — even with bad JPEG artifacts — and turn it into a reasonably clean heightfield. It is also useful for upscaling lower resolution data such as Google map extracts.
