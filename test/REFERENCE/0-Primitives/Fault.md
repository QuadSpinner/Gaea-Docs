uid: Fault
title: Fault
---

The Fault primitive creates a fault in the terrain. The shape can be anything from a crack to a valley, based on the settings.

If the Fault node is used by itself, it will create a fault in a flat terrain. To produce a fault in your existing terrain, attach it to another node.
