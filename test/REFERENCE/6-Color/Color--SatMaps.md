The SatMap node gives you access to hundreds of CLUT maps which were created from satellite data collected from around the globe.

SatMap works exactly like the CLUT node, except you pick from the built-in maps rather than make your own. Just change the Index slider (right-click for accurate changes) to choose a map.
