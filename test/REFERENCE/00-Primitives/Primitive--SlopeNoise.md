SlopeNoise is a unique primitive specifically for creating expansive sloping terrains. SlopeNoise's internal noise distortions create a shape that is very conducive to strong, flowing erosion.

| :--------------- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scale**        | 0 - 100% | TODO                                                     |
| **Displacement** | 0.04 - 0.40 | TODO                                                     |
| **Direction**    | 0 - 360     | TODO                                                     |
| **Seed**         | 0 - 128000  | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process. |



SlopeNoise is fantastic for medium range or close-up scenes, where you want to dramatically show the scale and height of the slope.
