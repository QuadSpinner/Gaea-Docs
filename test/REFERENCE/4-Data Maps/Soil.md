Soil Map creates a soil mask, with increased density in crevices or other areas where the slope allows for soil to settle. By increasing the Power value, a higher number of soil settling cycles are simulated. A low value provides a "fresh" sprinkling of dust with very little wind and other simulations to "move" the dust afterwards. High values perform more simulation cycles to sprinkle dust but also move it around (repeatedly).
