At its most basic, masking works exactly like you would use in a paint program: define an area and only that part is modified. A mask must always be a heightmap, not a color map. Brighter areas get affected more, darker areas affected less. In Gaea, you will mostly deal with two types of masking - process mask and blending mask. Process Mask Almost every node contains a Mask input port. If you connect a mask to a node, the processing of that node is applied only within the masked area. For example, if you mask a Terrace node, the terracing effect is applied to the brighter areas. The Mask node is often useful in a situation where you can manually draw a freehand mask. Blending Mask Blending Masks are more useful because they provide extra flexibility. To create a blending mask, two different nodes are connected to a Combine node.

Tiled Output vs. Tiled Processing Let's differentiate between tiled output and tiled processing: Tiled Output is when the build results (regardless of how they were built) are saved in a grid - that is, the overall output is split into even tiles. Tiled Output is used for very large terrains, especially in games, where parts of the terrain are streamed into memory for efficiency. Tiled Processing or Distributed Processing is when a terrain is divided up into a grid of tiles before processing. After processing, the final output may be saved as individual tiles or as a single image. Tiled Processing is used to process very large terrains beyond what may be possible within the limits of your current hardware. By dividing the terrain into smaller tiles and processing them one by one, a remarkably smaller amount of RAM is needed for processing.

We use the Lakes node to create the water surface. However, for creating the ground texture, we attached the Texture node directly to the Erosion node instead. This is the best way to texture terrains with water: create the color maps for the terrain and water surface separately and merge them afterwards. The Depth output from the Lakes node goes to a CLUTer node, which is then attached to Combine with the SatMaps for the terrain using 100% Blend mode. The Lakes Mask output is used to mask the blending process. Next we edit the CLUTer node to change the black and white gradient to something more appropriate for water. The bottom of the gradient maps to the darker (closer to the surface) parts of the Depth mask, while the top maps to the lighter (deeper) parts.
