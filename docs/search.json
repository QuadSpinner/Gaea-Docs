depending on your installation location you may need administrative privileges. download the latest version. run the downloaded .exe file. by default gaea installs to c program files quadspinner gaea but can be directed to any other folder. for security purposes we recommend the c program files folder. once setup complete gaea will launch. follow the on-screen questions to set up your default preferences. the gaea central project repository and build stacks are placed in documents gaeaby default. however you can change this folder to any other location through theinstaller or at any later time via the preferences.clean installation if you were using our older exe installers or have encountered an issue in new build we recommend clean installation. download the full installer from the link above and after installation run watson. you can choose the clean install option.creating portable installation by default gaea stores its user data in c users [username] appdata roaming quadspinner gaea(or gaea bleeding edge for bleeding edge version.). you can force gaea to use the installation folder itself. go to the folder where gaea installed and create new subfolder called userdata. now when you start gaea it will use this folder for all user data and settings.you must have write privileges for this folder. additionally the existing appdata folder will be ignored. if you want to transfer the same settings copy the contents of the c users [username] appdata roaming quadspinner gaeafolder into the userdata subfolder.administrative install and mass deployment see

production ready builds are stable and thoroughly tested both by the qa team and regular users. they are released 1-2 times each month. bleeding edge features are rolled into these builds slowly once they undergo thorough testing.bleeding edge bleeding edge builds are released 1 or more times per cycle. they are mostly stable but not fully ready for production. you get to try new features as they are added and provide early feedback so we can modify them to your satisfaction.install side-by-side both builds install to different locations and do not share settings or registry entries. this gives you the flexibility to try new features without endangering your work projects.version scheme version such as 1.0.30.5 comprised of 4 elements major . minor . build . revision major only changed when new payable version released. this happens perhaps once every 2 years. minor updated when major set of features added. this usually happens few times per year. build updated every time there new release in the production ready branch. this happens 1-2 times each month. revision updated every time new build released in thebleeding edge channel. this can happen 1 or more times each week. revision also incremented when bleeding edge build rolled into the production ready branch.the revision element was reset with the release of gaea 1.0.28 to avoid confusion with the frequent bleeding edge updates. common issuesif gaea fails to start ensure gaea.exe and archon.exe have firewall permissions for local tcp ip communication. install the latest cpu and gpu drivers. ensure you have at least 10gb of free space in your windows temp directory and in the cache folder set in gaea preferences. if none of these work run watson and file ticket. our support team will help you figure out the

viewport toolbar gives you access to all the options for both the viewports and the lighting for the terrain. for further details see viewport.graph surface the graph the core of gaea. this where you take nodes from the toolbox and implement them on the graph surface. the toolbox menu allows you to change the toolboxs configuration such as full size or expert mode. the graph can be split into multiple tabs which are shown above the nodes. the tabs also share space with key graph tools on the far right such as pinned nodes the baking menu and more.the corner menu in the graph gives you additional options to move nodes between graphs for further details see graph.properties panel the properties panel lets you modify the nodes on the graph surface. when you select node the properties for it will be visible here. the post process stack available at the bottom of the properties panel. these adjustment options can help you skip the need to create additional nodes. between these the apply lock button. if node takes long time to process and has been marked as heavy or you have toggled auto apply changes to the node properties are not applied until you click apply. for further

node from the toolbox and dropping it on an existing node will automatically connect it to nodes primary output. if another node already exists the new node will be automatically organized for you.interject node drop interjectif you hold shift and drop node on an existing node the new node will interject itself between all the outgoing primary connections of the node. drag interjectif you hold shift then drag an independent node (not connected to any other node) over connection and release the mouse the node will interject itself between the 2 nodes of the existing connections.replace

and those too are mostly in the form of rivers. such textures make digital terrains extremely conspicuous. with cutting-edge software like gaea there are many options for generating data maps at any point in the graph. this removes the need for erosion data for texturing purposes. you can use texture to create the base for any procedural color map. flow soil rockmap occlusion and other data maps can generate texture-friendly data without actually processing the terrain. see the tutorials section for practical examples.erosion mandatory another old belief erosion required after any processing to ensure the terrain looks believable. while this may be true in some cases if you are using lookdev nodes or other erosion processes applying hydraulic erosion may detract from the non-hydraulic-eroded look you desire because it creates soft soil deposits and erosive flows. lookdev nodes such as canyonizer stacks anastomosis shear etc. can create effects dont need to be reprocessed with erosion to be believable. see tut-rugged-outcrops for an example of how lookdev nodes can eliminate the need for manual erosion.thermal erosion thermal erosion the sister to hydraulic erosion. while used less frequently thermal erosion equally as important in most environments.debris from erosion ^wipcombining with hydraulic erosion in the real world hydraulic and thermal erosion occur together. you can mimic this behavior by chaining thermal and erosion (or wizard) nodes as shown in the layering erosion section above. chained sequence of wizard erosion and thermal nodes selective processing can be very powerful tool in such chain of nodes.understanding anisotropy thermal stress anisotropy governs how erosion and the resulting rock deposits are shaped. it smooths the terrain while eroding. low values largely keep the original terrain intact. high values create stronger talus while eroding the original terrain. for example sharp peaks get eroded heavily with high stress values. the image below shows simplified version of how thermal stress anisotropy affects terrain.

time. you can use these nodes to save specific port to different name format and so on. lets take this example we have two heavy nodes snowfall and erosion. we need to save both in 32-bit raw format. however when we set the format in the build tab the extra maps such as snow flow and wear will also be saved as .r32. this problem because those lightweight masks are better off as 16-bit png files for easier consumption. so what we do set the erosion and snowfall nodes output save option in the build tab from all to main. this can be done by opening menu item and selecting primary only. then we attach an fx node to the snow output of the snowfall node and another to the flow output of the erosion node. both fx nodes are then marked for export. in the build tab the output format for both set

Guide","title":"Understanding Resolution","text":"uid resolutions\r title understanding resolution\r section true resolution one of the central precepts of terrain design. when you work on terrain and especially when you export the amount of detail in the final result calculated based on the size or resolution of the export image. even when you export as mesh the image resolution critical. in gaea you work with 2 different resolutions preview resolution and export resolution. preview resolution the preview resolution controls the quality of detail of your terrain preview in the viewport. you can choose from 512 x 512 (0.5k) up to 4096 x 4096 (4k) resolution.the higher the resolution the more detail you will get. higher resolutions however can take 4x longer to process the image. switch to higher resolutions only when you need to. you can change preview resolutions as often as you like. when you switch the resolution the terrain preview rebuilt. for 0.5k and 1k previews the process usually fast. for 2k and 4k it can take longer.4k resolution previews are still experimental and not fully optimized. this may lead to slower performance with complex graphs. export resolution the export resolution controls the quality of detail in your built exported terrains. in gaea there no limit on maximum resolution except for what your hardware allows. by default you can export to resolutions of 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 (16k) and 32768 (32k).for resolutions beyond 16k we recommend using tiled-builds to contend with unlimited resolutions on even modest hardware. like with preview resolutions high export resolutions can take longer than the preview - something to be expected with builds. in essence when you create terrain at preview resolution youre creating template with your settings. when you build terrain gaea takes preview template and uses those settings to build the terrain from scratch using the full export resolution. this results in more detail than possible in previews. for more information on building terrains see build-manager. resolution dependence all terrains heightfields no matter how procedural are still bound to the limits of their resolution. while most aspects of gaea are resolution-independent - meaning an effect or shape will remain the same across different resolutions - there always chance certain shapes and effects may change across several nodes when seen at different resolutions. this natural side effect of heightfield-based terrains. to make sure the results are as expected it helpful to build and export the terrain at final resolution once in while. if the shapes change and you are unsure where on the graph it happens you can mark for export several key nodes in your graph and examine where the changes occur.forcing resolution if you want to enforce specific resolution you can do so manually by saving the graph up to the desired node at your desired resolution. then you can import it to new graph using the file node. this will upscale the file to the new final resolution."},{"url":"/Guide/Using-Gaea/Cache.html","hive":"User Guide","title":"Baking and Caching","text":"uid cache\r title baking and caching gaea uses various forms of baked caches to speed up processing and build times. bakingwhat baking? in gaea baking means building node to specific high resolution and then storing it in locked or baked form. baked node can display previews at higher resolution than your normal preview while allowing you to work with the current lower resolution previews for the rest of the graph. viewport previews at higher resolution enable you to discern finer detail and resolution-dependent shapes. however keeping your previews at 2k or 4k can be slow especially when working with large graphs. when part of the graph finalized and you do not anticipate any changes even temporarily you can bake part of the graph to prevent it from being reprocessed when the file loaded or the nodes are refreshed. if you select high resolution for the baking the baked preview will be stored at resolution while the rest of the unbaked nodes are shown at the current preview resolution. once further nodes are finalized you can bake those too. use the bake menu to choose baking options. with the bake menu in the graph toolbar you can choose the resolution for baking bake or unbake nodes and use the session cache.baked cache baking nodes can help save time when editing the graph or building the actual graph. unlike the session cache baked cache permanent. baked node cannot be edited unless it unbaked. to bake open the baking menu and select the resolution you want to use for baking. in most cases you should select the same resolution as your final build. once the resolution set select the node you wish to build and click bake selected in the baking menu. the selected node and all dependent nodes (the entire node tree left of the node aka ancestors) will be baked.changing the resolution after nodes have been baked will invalidate existing bakes. nodes can be baked to maximum of 8192 x 8192. higher resolutions will be available in the future. as portions of your graph are finalized you can bake them to prevent having to reprocess them repeatedly. when building the final terrain the build-swarm will use cache for those nodes instead of building them. this can significantly speed up build times. nodes can be unbaked through the baking menu.working fastersession cache session or soft cache helps resume your work faster the next time you open the file. it disabled by default so you have to opt-in to use it. to enable open the baking menu and enable cache graph on close. when closing the file whether by exiting gaea or switching to different file gaea will save all the processed nodes cache to file. next time you open the file instead of reprocessing all nodes from scratch gaea will load the session cache to memory.for better performance use solid state drive for

ancestors of linchpin nodes are not loaded thereby saving processing power and memory. consider this graph. the perlin node connected to 3 different nodes which eventually come to single multicombine node. the erosion node here relies only on the multicombine so keeping the data for the previous 4 nodes unnecessary. when you bake the multicombine node gaea will detect it the linchpin and unload the previous nodes. non-crucial nodes such as these are depicted with dotted border to show they are not loaded. baked nodes are not loaded can be loaded through the property editor. however if you wish to modify anything it recommended to unbake and bake portions of the graph.export from preview cache gaea can preview up to 4k. often you will work in 2k for high definition previews and want to save out the entire exportable node set at 2k for testing in your dcc application or game engine before firing off full build. to do this you run the build manager which rebuilds the whole world. but you already have the world built at 2k from your preview when your preview resolution and the export resolution are the same the build manager will ask you if you wish to just save the preview cache instead. this will save you time from having to rebuild an already built terrain.cache locations if your file myfile.tor the baked cache will be stored incaches hard myfile_09cb3a next to it. for

export any heightfield as mesh or point cloud using the mesher node. for more information on exporting assets see building. for the various building options see buildmanager.build types gaea can build your terrain in one of 3 different ways. each has advantages and disadvantages.normal build normal build the terrain built normally as single process. this the standard build type and works for most cases. with normal build gaea will build the entire terrain in single pass. if you think of it in traditional rendering terms the entire image single bucket. normal builds provide the highest quality

still limited to 8192 x 8192.distributed build tiled build the terrain built as seperated buckets which are then blended together. the distributed build also known as tiled build splits the terrain into tiles or buckets and builds them individually. the end result can be either set of tiles or reconstituted single image. the major advantage this build method does not have the same memory restrictions as the other builds and can therefore build terrains at virtually unlimited resolution sizes. the limitation of this build type each bucket while beingbuilt does not interact with neighboring buckets so slope interactions can be limited. the resulting tiles are blended with neighboring tiles to bypass this limitation. in most cases this enough to create seamless look but in

very easy to manipulate. the only downside of this method it uses the same number of polygons for any part of the terrain regardless of the complexity required. for example flat featureless area would use the same number of polygons as highly detailed peak.optimized mesh this method creates optimized terrains using our sophia algorithm. it creates clean triangles and subdivides them as needed based on the complexity of the underlying portion of the terrain. the main advantage of this method it can produce higher quality meshes while reducing the amount of polygons used. in most cases optimized meshes produce higher quality results than their grid counterparts and use fewer polygons. depending on the shape of your terrain you can reduce polygon count by 20-40%. in extreme cases with large

meshes can be exported in 2 scales normalized and metric. normalized scale enforces strict 0..1 range for values along all 3 axes. metric scale enforces 1 unit = 1 meter so typical gaea terrain of 5000 meters would be 0..5000 units. the main advantage of normalized meshes many modern obj importers let you apply scale multiplier which you can use to scale the terrain very easily. you just need to use the width of the terrain in meters (see scale). for example the default terrain 5000 meters wide. you can use 5000 as multiplier when importing and your terrain should scale to 5000 meters.texture mapping by default all mesh exports include texture coordinates. in special circumstances you can turn off texture coordinate generation. regardless of the method used to export the mesh it will use simple planar mapping. in most 3d applications you can apply simple planar mapping of the exact size of the object to get full uv mapping. you can turn off texture coordinates and your file size can become 30% smaller. this can be quite helpful when youre working with very dense meshes. since obj plain-text format most parsers can take quite while to import. without texture coordinates this process can be 33% faster. once imported in your dcc application you can apply planar uv mapping to the object.normal mapping gaea currently does not include

precisely-scaled terrains terrain definition your best friend. terrain definition the terrain definition popup found in the main toolbar.you define the height of your terrain in meters. the scale determines the extent of the entire terrain. by default gaea terrains are set to be 2.6km tall (height 2600m) and 5 x 5 square kilometers wide (scale 5000m). internally the terrain vertical ratio calculated as (height scale) height of 2.6km usually more than enough for most terrains. for perspective mt. everest 8.8km tall. choosing an extreme height not recommended unless you know how to

like.important readouts for terrain scale in the terrain definition you get 2 readouts real scale and height-scale ratio. real scale this the pixel-to-meters density for your output. it calculated by dividing your final output resolution (selected in the build manager) by the scale in meters set in the terrain definition. for example 5000 x 5000 meter terrain exported at 2048 x 2048 pixels results in 2.4 meters per pixel. you can change your output resolution to see the exact ratio you get. this information often used by game designers to ensure scale accuracy between the terrain and other game elements. height-scale ratio ratio of the imaginary cube. if you export using raw or normalized scale and need to resize your terrain you can resize it by this ratio. the ratio simply height scale.scale philosophy scale in all cg an imaginary construct. with gaea and heightfields we have pixels when using an image format or an array of floats when using raw format. gaea terrain in its most basic form cube made of infinite numbers which must be translated to fixed size as defined by the output resolution and image format. for example if your output resolution 2048 x 2048 then the size of the terrain in pixels 2048 on either side - this uniform across all image and raw formats. the vertical capacity defined by the maximum storage capacity of the format. 32-bit tiff exr raw and pfm can store approximately one million levels of vertical heights.gaea stores and processes heightfields as floats (a high precision number). heights are stored in~0.0000000 - 1.0000000 range. for the more technically minded this just simplification. gaea uses ieee 754 format 32-bit floats. this image shows the cube of the default terrain size which 5000 x 5000 meters wide and 2600 meters tall. you will notice our cube not an exact cube; it shorter than it wide. for realistic use we must visualize the data the way we perceive mountains in the real world. so we force height-to-width ratio to satisfy the human perception of scale for terrains. if you want perfect cube your height and scale must be the same. in this image our terrain 5000 x 5000 meters and 5000 meters tall. so why dont we use perfect cube? because it distorts our perception of terrains. this what perlin noise would look like in the cube format. this what the same noise looks like with height-to-width ratio applied. as you can see it fits our perception better. it important to note all these transformations are imaginary. the underlying data still fixed grid of numbers.the only place the terrain scale affects how your terrain processed when real scale turned on in the erosion snow or thermal nodes. although they can be overridden per node. this begs the question of how do you the user translate this to practical metrics for exporting and usage in other applications or game engines.practical usage of the scale philosophy when exporting the terrain as an image heightmap you must make fundamental decision keep the natural scale without applying perceptual ratio. bake the perceptual ratio mentioned above into the pixels. force the terrain to use the entire bit-range of the image format. these options are known as the output range options in the build manager. see building for information on setting those options. below we will discuss the implications of each option. there no right or wrong way to scale the output range. it depends on what target application you are using and how.raw scale technically this the most accurate representation of the terrain because the output exactly what the software itself sees when processing. but it will not be perceptually accurate. you will need to manually scale the output along the vertical axis. an easy way in most applications to create box of the desired size and match the scale of the terrain asset. or if you use heightmap as displacement source then you can set the displacement in meters (or appropriate units). if you need to scale it down vertically use the height-scale ratio explained in important readouts above.proportional or baked scale this method will bake the ratio you see in the viewport into the heightfield. this very useful when exporting meshes. you lose minor amount of vertical fidelity but unless you are creating closeups of the terrain it will not affect you. when bringing the terrain into your target application you can optionally treat it as perfect cube and your ratio already baked into the vertical values.normalized scale forced scaling in many situations can give you maximum vertical fidelity. gaea will force the terrain to use the entire ~0.0000000 - 1.0000000 height range in 32-bit formats (16.7 million levels). in 16-bit images would be 0 - 65534. in 8-bit it 0 - 254. if you need more vertical fidelity for closeups this option may help because you get more density in the up-axis than in other methods. when using forced scaling you must adjust the vertical size of your output manually in the target application. like with natural scale use the height-scale ratio.custom scale this special option reserved for importing and exporting data in very specific ranges. in most normal circumstances you will not need to use this mode. if you wish to use this mode for automation scenarios see create-bridge and buildmanager."},{"url":"/Guide/Build/Tiled.html","hive":"User Guide","title":"Preparing Terrains for Tiled Build","text":"uid tiled-builds\r title preparing terrains for tiled build split build split build the terrain built normally then split into uniform grid. split builds require very little special consideration. you can change any terrain from normal build to split build without modification. this because the terrain built normally and then split into chunks. this usually used when your terrain has to be in chunks (aka tiles) for consumption in your game engine or cg app but it just 8192 x 8192 or smaller in size. if your terrain 8k or smaller then this our recommended method for creating game engine compatible chunks. it usually faster and produces very accurate results. tiled distributed builds tiled build the terrain built as seperated buckets which are then blended together.tilegates many gaea nodes often use screenspace transformations or effects. this means theyre not compatible with tiled build. for example the swirl effect if applied on tiled build would create separate swirl in the middle of each tile. however you can use the tilegate nodes to bypass this restriction. the tilegate note tells gaea the nodes before it need to be preserved at screenspace. so before building the tiled build the tilegate nodes are baked with special settings. during the build process gaea will upscale the tiles specific portion with detail preserving algorithm and then continue the build normally with all the subsequent tile-friendly nodes.you can have multiple tilegates in graph. they do not add any additional burden to your memory so feel free to use as many as needed. simple example you have mountain primitive which eroded then exported. the mountain node like all primitives are tile-unfriendly. so you just place tilegate in between the mountain and erosion nodes. the rest of the graph will remain unaffected.tilegate uses the same baking resolution as the rest of your graph. you can choose either the highest possible resolution (8k) or if your primitives are simpler shapes you can use lower resolutions and let erosion and other nodes handle adding the smaller detail.identifying non-tiling nodes when you select tiled build mode in the buildmanager nodes do not tile are marked with an asterisk ◇ in the toolbox menus andsearch.warnings you will find warnings at the bottom of the buildmanager. for tiled builds there are two primary warnings.non-tiling nodesthis warning tells you some nodes are not tile friendly and would need to be moved behind tilegate.if you click the warning you will be presented with an option to mark the actual nodes with an * prefix in their names. this can help you go through your graph and move them behind tilegates.unbaked tilegatesthis warning tells you tilegates are not baked. you must bake them in order to run tiled build.if you click the warning gaea will give you the option to automatically bake all pending tilegates at the current baking resolution.example lets look at more detailed example terrain made with few primitives processed textured and exported. we will interject tilegate nodes at key places to make this world tile friendly. first we go to the build manager and select the tiled build (preview) mode then assign the desired resolution per tile and the number of tiles per dimension. the readout under the settings gives you the final resolution of the entire tileset.the existing graph the first portion where the overall shape created but not detailed with erosion yet the main sequence of nodes would be not be tile friendly. the mask used further down the chain also not tile friendly. as such they need to be put behind tilegate nodes. the remaining nodes are all tile friendly and require no further modifications. it important to remember most of the small high-resolution details in terrains generated during this phase.graph with tilegates we add our first tilegate where the two primitives are combined and the second right after the mask. now the terrain ready to buildmaintaining qualityblending when the terrain split into tiles and processed at the end each tile needs to be blended with its surrounding neighbors so any edge-mismatches can be fixed. in most cases 25% (the default) sufficient. if you still find artifacts or mismatching borders after loading your tile set you can increase the blending amount. but be careful increasing the blending amount will directly increase the memory and build time. avoid using high blend amounts unless absolutely needed.detail preservation you dont need to be concerned with losing detail in this process. almost all nodes are not tile-friendly dont create very high resolution detail. it mostly erosion and lookdev processes create intricate shapes and most of them are tile-friendly. ensure they are placed outside of tilegates. if you do lose bit of detail use wizard with fast erosion settings after the tilegate. this will add enough 11 resolution details to hide any artifacts create from upscaling."},{"url":"/Guide/Build/Swarm.html","hive":"User Guide","title":"Build Swarm","text":"title build swarm\r uid build-swarm the build swarm the command line building

limit 2500m however the tallest point in your terrain only 800m then you are only using approximately 30% of the available range (in other words you use only 20k out of the 65k range). however before you go and change your terrain definition to use lower limit it much easier to use the full range. when building your terrain set your output range to normalized in buildmanager. when importing into your target application you will need to scale down on the vertical axis after importing. this will ensure the proportions can be preserved while tricking the use of the full 16-bit range. for the

values or 16-million grades of slope. this significantly higher than the 65k of the 16-bit format. see save-formats for more information on 32-bit raw (.r32) openexr and tiff formats. however many game engines still dont use 32-bit floats for storage and use half or 16-bit floats.workaround normalize the output as explained in scale your terrains may often use only portion of the 16-bit range. for example if your terrains defined limit 2500m and the tallest point in your terrain just 800m then you are only using approximately 30% of the available range (in other words youre using only 20k out of the 65k range). however before you change your terrain definition to use lower limit it much easier to use the full range. when building your terrain set your output range to normalized in buildmanager. when importing into your target application you will need to scale down on the vertical axis after importing. this will ensure the proportions can be preserved while tricking the use of the full 16-bit range. for the vertical scaling ration see important readouts in scale."},{"url":"/Guide/Appendix/Nahimic.html","hive":"User Guide","title":"Conflict with Nahimic","text":"uid

namely the width of largest valleys and ridges between them - controlled by the feature scale option where you can achieve artistic control over the erosion process. default feature size of 2000 (meters). reduced feature size of 50 (meters). the real scale option automatically controls the general scale (the extents of the terrain and the vertical scale) using the scale set in the terrain definition. although it can be turned off to manually change the physics of the erosion system although it not recommended for most scenarios.when using parallel processing the erosion algorithm can become non-deterministic. this means while most of the major flows will appear in the same location smaller features may appear somewhat different every time the node processed. to ensure fully deterministic processing disable parallel processing. this will sacrifice processing speed to ensure your results are consistent.sediment removal the new sediment removal feature lets you remove sediment deposits generated by the erosion process. by default the property applies uniformly across the entire terrain but it can be driven by heightfield or mask. ^todoimageselective processing selective processing one of the most powerful tools available in the erosion process. you can provide bias mask to drive aspects of the erosion process namely rock softness erosion strength and precipitation amount. ^todoimage it may sound like simple masking however there significant difference between masking the erosion node and using selective processing. with masking the effect tightly contained within the provided mask using compositing method (the same as using combine at 100% blend while providing mask). while with selective processing the mask provided will apply modifier to area however processing will still occur outside the bias mask.processing mask you can use two forms of masking for the selective processing the built-in masks called bias types or custom mask provided via the area input. custom masks can be any heightfield. the built-in bias masks are slope and altitude. they are mainly provided for convenience so you can quickly apply selective processing and be able to use it frequently without creating several nodes. both aspects go from 0 to maximum in normalized scale. this means 0% the bottom while 100% the top. for example if you want to mask the last 10% of mountain peak you would use 90% for the altitude bias. you can invert the mask by enabling reverse. the bias mask modulates or drives the value of the parameter across the terrain region. for example if you provide rock softness mask while your rock softness parameter set to 35% it will map the black or 0 part to 0% while the white will map to 35%. similarly erosion strength maps to the strength slider and precipitation amount maps to the duration slider.data output the erosion and wizard nodes create three key data outputs data  description     -   wear  the portions where erosion removes sediments.   deposits  the resting position of those sediments.  flow  the path of the sediments from their original location to the final resting position.  these maps can be used for texturing or for driving other nodes.like other data maps the output may not be readily visible to the human eye. you can use fx to autolevel or equalize the output. you can also use abs to create solid mask.in digital terrains inexperienced artists will often try to use the flow output too prominently for texturing. while this may work in some situations it tends to create unrealistic textures and can make your terrain look fake and cg. see the misconceptions section below.determinstic output it worth noting due to the nature of the algorithm and parallel processing the erosion flow may differ slightly each time. to ensure 100% exact results every time you can turn on the deterministic option in the erosion node. this will force gaea to use single processor core which will result in slower processing but will ensure your results are completely predictable. this may not always be necessary. there are also workarounds. for example if you wish to control certain major flow lines you can create mask for the starting points of those flows and feed it to selective processing. this usually best done in second erosion node while the first one provides general erosion across the terrain.further reading see erosions for general information on erosion how it applies to procedural terrains and misconceptions about erosion. see these tutorials for examples of practical usage tut-selective-erosion tut-multipass-erosionpropertieserosion duration determines the duration of erosion simulation. this parameter can be set to higher value than 1.0 but note even default 0.04 (4%) enough for most cases resulting in prominent erosion effect. low duration values such as 0.02 and lesser can be useful for adding erosion details while keeping the main original landscape features unchanged. rock softness controls the softness of rock material. the softer rock is the faster erosion process. strength sets the strength of fluvial erosion. this parameter controls the sediment transport capacity how much of dissolved minerals water can carry. this parameter can be set to value higher than 1.0 this can speed up the erosion process but also can result in lesser erosion quality especially if erosion softness value high too. downcutting downcutting this parameter controls the amount of downcutting or vertical erosion. this additional erosion mechanics allowing water to transport sediments beyond the fluvial capacity by dragging and moving undissolved materials. this results in deeper gullies and can be useful for getting mountain ranges. inhibition this parameter controls special mechanics adding additional restraints for downcutting. it determines how undissolved sediments are slowed down by already dropped sediments causing downcutting to stop and drop its load. this allows to combine both variants of erosion with and without downcutting resulting at deep channels at some areas and alluvial fans in other areas. base level controls the base level for the vertical erosion process this the lowest elevation downcutting process can erode until it stops and begins to drop sediment. this elevation different across the whole terrain and depends on the terrain slopes relative altitudes stream velocity and other factors. this parameter can be useful for filling the largest valleys with deposit material forming valley floors. scale real scale automatically determine the scale from the terrain definition. feature scale determines the lateral size of the largest erosion features in meters width of largest valleys and ridges between them. terrain scale the simulated scale of the entire width of the terrain. (available when rivers turned on) verticality the simulated height of the entire terrain. (available when rivers turned on) flow random sedimentation this parameter controls randomization of sedimentation process. in the cases of usual uniform erosion it rarely has effect because multiple flows dropping sediments randomly results in uniform deposition field thus cancelling random sedimentation effect. this parameter for some non-standard scenarios for example masked precipitation where precipitation occurs at some areas only. volume this another special parameter which alters erosion physics treating water flows as volumetric objects affecting each other causing higher water levels during simulation which results in wider channels filled with more deposits. this another way to get valley floor and it works without downcutting. sediment removal removes the sediment produced in the erosion process. this can be modulated using the sedimental removal mask input. selective processing area effect this the effect applied when an area input specified or if bias defined in the settings. erosion strengththe input mask controls the erosion strength. rock softnessthe input mask controls the rock softness. precipitation amountin this mode mask controls rained areas allowing to rainfall to occur in the selected area only. the brighter mask is the more water rained. this masking mode allows to avoid boring look of uniformly eroded terrain. nonedo not apply selective processing.bias type the type of automatic bias to apply when an area input not specified. bias the strength of the bias. for slope it the steepness for altitude it the position from bottom. reverse reverse the bias direction. other settings seed the randomization pattern or seed for the nodes process. aggressive mode process erosion faster at the risk of creating soft erosion artifacts in some minor areas. deterministic (slow) parallel processing using all cpu cores can create small variations every time the node built. you can enable deterministic processing to ensure the exact same shape produced every time. however this will force the algorithm to reduce its parallelism and use single cpu core.
