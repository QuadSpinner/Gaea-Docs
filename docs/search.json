At its most basic, masking works exactly like you would use in a paint program: define an area and only that part is modified. A mask must always be a heightmap, not a color map. Brighter areas get affected more, darker areas affected less. In Gaea, you will mostly deal with two types of masking - process mask and blending mask. Process Mask Almost every node contains a Mask input port. If you connect a mask to a node, the processing of that node is applied only within the masked area. For example, if you mask a Terrace node, the terracing effect is applied to the brighter areas. The Mask node is often useful in a situation where you can manually draw a freehand mask. Blending Mask Blending Masks are more useful because they provide extra flexibility. To create a blending mask, two different nodes are connected to a Combine node.

Even when you export as a mesh, the image resolution is critical. In Gaea, there are two different resolutions you work with: Preview Resolution and Export Resolution. Preview Resolution The Preview Resolution controls the quality of detail of your terrain preview in the viewport. You can choose from 512 x 512 (0.5K) up to 4096 x 4096 (4K) resolution.  The higher the resolution, the more detail you will get. Higher resolutions, however, can take 4x longer to process the image. Switch to higher resolutions only when you need to.

Tiled Output vs. Tiled Processing Let's differentiate between tiled output and tiled processing: Tiled Output is when the build results (regardless of how they were built) are saved in a grid - that is, the overall output is split into even tiles. Tiled Output is used for very large terrains, especially in games, where parts of the terrain are streamed into memory for efficiency. Tiled Processing or Distributed Processing is when a terrain is divided up into a grid of tiles before processing. After processing, the final output may be saved as individual tiles or as a single image. Tiled Processing is used to process very large terrains beyond what may be possible within the limits of your current hardware. By dividing the terrain into smaller tiles and processing them one by one, a remarkably smaller amount of RAM is needed for processing.

Adjust the Blur and Iterations until you get the right level of softness. More softness means gentler transitions for the main terrain. Remember to use a low Strength setting in the mask editor. If you need both raise and lower capability, you can set up two different masks - one that Subtracts while the other Adds. Or you can choose 50% Strength and paint over the entire mask surface.

First, we set up a SlopeNoise and erode it. The Erosion settings of high downcutting values (all 3 sliders) are to promote wider, sandier flows.  Then we create a Perlin with low octaves and clamp it down to a flat-ish state.  Finally, subtract the Wear map from the Perlin. "},{"url":"/Learning/Techniques/Multipass-Erosion.html","hive":"Tutorials","parent":"Techniques","title":"Multipass Erosion","text":"A great way to create sophisticated erosion is to use multiple Erosion nodes. A single erosion pass is fine, but will restrict you because of the settings you can use. In this example, we have Selective Processing set to Altitude with high Duration of 30% for creating the initial pass. The strong grooves/flow structure it creates will guide the erosion in subsequent passes.  For the second pass, we have default settings except for 100% Downcutting and 100% Base Level. This creates strong flow structures everywhere.  The third pass is fully default. It takes the general larger variations created in the previous passes and homogenizes the overall texture yet keeps the larger features. Optionally, higher Inhibition can be used to create more sediments at the bottom.

This basic technique will show you how to do that, and leverage the Erosion node's capabilities in creating new mountains out of a simple shape. We start with this basic Mountain. We can take the main peak and turn it into a much larger, slightly isolated peak - like something you might find in the Alps.  We will use the Erosion node to help create that peak. But Erosion needs a lot of bulk to erode into a mountainous shape, and our peak right now is too shallow. So we use a Height node to mask out the top of the peak.  Then we use that as a mask for the Clamp node. By pushing up the Clamp's minimum, we elongate that peak while retaining a relatively clean boundary with the rest of the terrain. The shape is not attractive, but that won't matter.  For creating the actual peak, we send the same Height mask to the Erosion node as an Area input. By turning on Selective Processing and setting it to Precipitation Amount, we ensure rainfall occurs only in that region. We increase Strength and Duration, as well as Random Sedimentation and Inhibition.

Shatter can help you create that in just 2 steps. Create a Plates node and use the Post Process Stack to Clamp the output to a level of flatness that you like. In this case we have it set to 33 and 24. Next add the Shatter node. And that's it - you're done! You further improve this with other nodes, or use Texture and RockMap with SatMaps to texture the terrain.

Switch the Apex node to Slant mode and adjust the A/B settings until you have a shape that looks pleasing to you.  Duplicate the node and attach it to the Apex node. In the second node, change the Angle to 90 degrees.  Add a Displace node to the end to warp the shape a bit.  Experiment with different A/B settings and angles to get different permutations.

The key element here is not use the output directly, but to use the Erosion output to modify the terrain. First we start with an eroded mountain that has been terraced. We use the terracing to create obstacles for the erosion process. As it erodes the terraces, specific sediment shapes will be formed. Next we erode the terrain using very high settings. Random Sedimentation is quite important. We use Selective Processing so only the top gets eroded completely, while ejecta from up there falls all the way down in rocky lumps. Then we turn on the Diff blend mode in the Post Process Stack so the output is the difference between the original terraced terrain and the erosion output. This gives us a terrain formed of just the rocky material and broken terraces. Finally, we use Combine to subtract the erosion output from the terraced terrain. This leaves us with a rocky, craggy mountain which still exposes some terraces, but also features a lot of rocky deposits.

Yes, for Community, Indie, and Professional editions you need an internet connection to activate the license, and at least once every 30 days to keep the license active. The Enterprise edition can be both activated offline and not require an internet connection to stay activated. Is Gaea GPU powered? Gaea uses the GPU primarily for visualizing data rather than processing it. Our algorithms are primed for CPU usage. While it may feel that may be a loss as modern GPUs can process heavy data, our algorithms can create elaborate effects not possible with current methods of GPU processing. Gaea's nodes are heavily multi-threaded and can use your CPU cores to the maximum as needed. Can I use Gaea on a Mac or Linux? Gaea currently runs on Windows 7.1 or higher.
