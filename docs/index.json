Introduction to the User Interface The Gaea interface is streamlined Interface Sections The Graph surface is where you construct your terrain using different nodes. The Toolbox is where all nodes are located. You can drag and drop a node to the Graph surface to create a node. The Properties panel is where you can modify the properties of the node selected on the Graph surface. The 3D Viewport lets you explore the terrain in real time. It shows the output of the currently selected node. The 2D Viewport provides an unbiased view of the terrain or mask output of the currently selected node. The main toolbar, including the Gaea menu, is where you can access file commands, viewport modes, and terrain options such as materials, terrain definition, atmosphere, and water surface display. The Graph toolbar provides quick access to common node commands. Most of these commands are also available by right-clicking the nodes themselves. The Favorites panel is a handy way to access your most used nodes without having to go to the Toolbox . You can right-click nodes in the Toolbox to add or remove them from favorites. The Gaea interface is resolution independent. If you're working on a HiDPI display, you can scale the entire interface using the Zoom slider. Certain aspects of the interface are altered depending on the workflow you have selected. The Node Graph is hidden when you work in Layers Workflow . The Toolbox is made visible when you work in Graph Workflow .

    "title": "Sculpt Workflow | QuadSpinner Gaea",
    "keywords": "This documentation is a work-in-progress and subject to change. Understanding Directed Erosion Directed Erosion works in its own \"Sculpt mode\". In this example, we have a simple setup at 512 x 512 preview resolution. When you add the Directed Erosion node, you will notice it has its own independent resolution. In most cases, this should be the final output resolution. Directed Erosion is intended for fine detailing, and works at an independent resolution from the preview and final build resolutions. This Sculpt Resolution can be upscaled or downscaled as needed. The Pros and Cons of Directed Erosion Working in 1:1 Resolution In an effort to prevent memory excesses, the Sculpt mode will only show a 2048 x 2048 area. While the mini map in the sidebar let's you navigate the entire terrain, you can only see a 2K area at a time in the viewport. Regardless of your target size, Directed Erosion's strokes are always processed at the same speed, whether at 2K or 32K! Erosion Tools The Erosion Tools become available when you enter the Sculpt mode. This floating window lets you select an erosion tool, modify its setting, and choose an erosion mode. Each erosion tool creates a different effect. Some have secondary variations. LandBreaker - general, all purpose erosive breakdown. Flowlines - creates Breaker style broad flow lines. Soil - soil deposit tool. Great with Infinite Flow. WideFlow - creates wide, long flows. Carver - strong, rock carving. Use sparingly! Gullies - create gentle, flowing gullies. Pockmarks - creates small impact holes. Use for detailing. Rocks - creates rock flows. Great with Infinite Flow. RoughFlow - chaotic soil/rock flows. Roughness - detailing tool to roughen surfaces. Scratch - detailing tool to create superficial scratches. Sedimentary - strong soil flows. Properties While properties differ between some tools, there is a general pattern: Size - the size of your tool's impact area. Note that this is the impact area, where the effect begins. However, if your tool's effect generates erosive flows, these flows will go beyond the impact area. (That's the beauty of Directed Erosion - its not just simple masking.) Duration - this is the duration of the effect simulation. Be cautious when using long duration values as they can take quite some time. Get a feel for the tools before modifying this value too much. Power - this is the strength of the erosion simulation. In most cases, you should leave it as-is. When using Infinite Flow, you can increase this value without too much penalty. In Normal or Erosive modes, it can shatter the terrain and create bad debris artifacts. Flow Distance - this is how far erosive flows should reach beyond the impact area. The longer the flow, the more processing it will require. Soil vs Rocks - the granularity of the erosive material. Low values create soft soil; high values create rocks and boulders. Erosion Mode Normal Flow - this is the default mode where erosion behaves normally. Erosion will both take away material from your terrain and deposit it elsewhere. Infinite Flow - in this mode, erosive debris/material is deposited but never removed. It is great for adding soil, talus, and other material without taking away from your terrain. In other words, it generates soil and rocks from thin air. Erosive Flow - in this mode the effect is the exact opposite of Infinite Flow. Material is taken away, but nothing is deposited. You can keep eroding an area without creating deposits downstream. Undo The Erosion Tool panel provides a local \"in-session\" Undo function accessible next to the tools. You can undo up to 20 tool impacts. Sculpting When the Sculpt mode is active, your cursor in the viewport shows the impact area. The cursor flows over the terrain to show you the flow conditions and impact extents - very useful with large brush sizes. Click anywhere on the terrain to create a \"stroke\" using the selected tool. In this case, we use the Landbreaker tool to create a few random strokes. // TODO: Image You will notice that, while the base terrain uses the preview resolution (512 x 512), the strokes and their effects on the terrain are at your sculpt's target resolution (2048 x 2048). This lets you preview the effect your final build will have regardless of your preview quality. Once you are satisfied with your sculpt, turn the Sculpt mode off. You will notice that your high resolution sculpt is downscaled to the preview resolution, and may lose a lot of the detail. If we switch the preview resolution to 2048 x 2048, the Directed Erosion node will reprocess the strokes and show them with higher fidelity. <!--tip--> Use late in the workflow Directed Erosion becomes moot if you process your terrain greatly. We recommend using it late in your graph after all the major shape changes are complete. This will save you hassles in the long run. Use in a separate file Here's a great way to separate the impact of Directed Erosion from the rest of your graph: save the output from your Graph, load that output in a new file using the File node, and then apply Directed Erosion to it. <!--/tip-->"

While Selector masks generally represent an area or selection - such as slope, angle, or curvature; Data Maps represent a specific type of data of the area - such as water flow, soil deposits, etc. These nodes break the traditional basic data (slope, angle, curvature) + chaos (Perlin noise) method used to create pseudo-random masks from which color maps would be generated. In such situations, you need to find a good seed to make it work. With Data Maps, there is visual randomness, but it is created from systematic analysis of the terrain and follows natural principles. The resulting color maps created from such data look more believable. Data Maps are very useful for creating color maps. For example, the water flow can be used to create a Biome texture, or used manually with a CLUTer or SatMaps node to create a texture along water flow areas. A basic texture with Data Maps In this example, we create a simple terrain using a Mountain node, then erode it to get some basic erosion data. On top of the eroded output, we apply a Soil Map node. The Soil Map node is fed to a SatMaps node to create a base texture for the terrain. The Flow and Wear output of the Erosion node are mixed and fed to another SatMaps node to create a second map. The two maps are mixed together to create the final texture. // TODO: Image See the Data Maps for Color Production for further information."

If either is not detected, the installer will try to download them automatically. Normal Install Installing Gaea is a simple process. Depending on your installation location, you may need administrative privileges. Download the latest version . Run the downloaded .exe file. By default, Gaea installs to C:\\Program Files\\QuadSpinner\\Gaea but can be directed to any other folder. For security purposes, we recommend the C:\\Program Files folder. Once setup is complete, Gaea will launch. Follow the on-screen questions to set up your default preferences. The Gaea central project repository and build stacks are placed in Documents\\Gaea\\ by default. However, you can change this folder to any other location through the introduction dialog, or at any later time via the Preferences. Admin Install Enterprise Edition only The Gaea installer is flexibly built for administrative and unattended installations. Download the latest administrative install package . Unzip the package and deploy remotely as per your preferences. Ensure the prerequisites (.NET and VC Runtime) are installed on the end-machine. They have their own unattended install options. Authorization Options Run the command line Gaea.exe -install \"C:\\license.qkey\" pointing to the local or network location of the license key. This will authorize the installation. Alternatively, copy the license file to the same folder as Gaea.exe . Floating Server This feature is currently in development and may not be available until version 1.1. Please contact technical support for an interim alternative. Clean Installation If you were using our older EXE installers, or have encountered an issue in a new build, we recommend a clean installation. Removing old installations The old EAPs were installed using a self-extracting executable (SFX), so there was no uninstall for them. You have to manually remove the files. Warning At this point, if you have already installed the MSI based Gaea EAP 6002, first uninstall that using the shortcut in the start menu (“Uninstall Gaea EAP”) or from the Control Panel. Then follow the steps below. Ensure Gaea.exe or Archon.exe are not running in Task Manager. End those processes if they are. If an uninstall entry is available in Control Panel, remove Gaea using the uninstaller. Delete the Gaea install folder. Typically C:\\Program Files\\QuadSpinner\\Gaea EAP . If you have multiple installs, delete all of them to avoid contamination. Delete the Gaea settings folder. Typically C:\\Users\\[YOU]\\AppData\\Roaming\\QuadSpinner\\Gaea . Please note, this will remove all your preferences so you will need to re-enter your settings. Delete the folder C:\\Users\\[YOU]\\AppData\\LocalLow\\QuadSpinner\\ . Delete any old shortcuts on your desktop, C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\QuadSpinner and C:\\Users\\[YOU]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\QuadSpinner If any of the above folders can’t be deleted, reboot your computer, then try again. Gaea does not use the registry for any functional purposes. There is no need to clean registry entries, as they don’t affect the workings of the software. Install a fresh copy With the old Gaea EAP and its residual traces removed, you can install anew. See the steps at the top. If Gaea does not launch or fails in between, run the Watson Diagnostics Tool in the start menu and send the log (generated on your desktop) to QuadSpinner Tech Support."

Soil Map creates a soil mask, with increased density in crevices or other areas where the slope allows for soil to settle. By increasing the Power value, a higher number of soil settling cycles are simulated. A low value provides a \"fresh\" sprinkling of dust with very little wind and other simulations to \"move\" the dust afterwards. High values perform more simulation cycles to sprinkle dust but also move it around (repeatedly). Setting Values Description Power 5 - 50 The power of soil deposits. Smaller values create detailed, small deposits. Larger values create less detailed but stronger deposits. Graded On / Off Creates stacked deposits with geometric progression, which produce softer gradations. Tip You can combine different Soil Maps using the Combine node set to Max. You can even combine with other Data Maps, such as Flow or Velocity, to create a texture mask upon which color production can take place. <!--examples-->"

Lateral enhances the terrain by providing a different method of eroding rocky river banks, and even underwater areas. Lateral follows the water flow, creating patterns based on the flows over and around obstacles. Ventral uses partially randomized, churning forces to erode the terrain. It works with two sets of forces: macro and micro, which interweave to use the shape of the terrain to drive the erosion. This erosion method uses horizontal flow mechanics (unlike hydraulic erosion), resulting in a look that flowing waters gently carved in the terrain over thousands of year. Setting Values Description Power 0 - 100% Higher values cause larger, smoother shapes and decay fine details. Lower values preserve details but create slightly rougher curves. Multiplier 1 - 10 Higher values cause the erosion to erase smaller features in the terrain by producing stronger flows. Form Lateral Ventral <!--examples-->"

You can choose the method that best suits your needs, and also switch between the two while working on the terrain. Layers // TODO: Image Layers are a deceptively simple way to craft terrains. You can stack nodes like Photoshop® layers. This is a great technique to quickly prototype a terrain or explore different ideas, without worrying about managing nodes. Layers are limited to one-to-one relationships, unlike a graph. Graphs can have one-to-many relationships, where you can create two different \"chains\" of creation and blend them together in myriad ways. Read more about this workflow in the @Layers-Mode section. Graph // TODO: Image The Graph provides a sophisticated workflow that is very flexible. Like any other graph-based workflow, you get both simple and complex functions packed into nodes which you can connect to each other to create a network that produces a terrain. Read more about this workflow in the @Graph-Mode section Next steps Familiarize yourself with the different tools and interfaces available in Gaea in Getting around , and start exploring some of the Quickstarts examples to see how terrains can be made."

    "keywords": "This documentation is a work-in-progress and subject to change. Lookup Tables All coloration in Gaea is based on CLUTs, or color lookup tables. As 2D heightfields are essentially a grid of numbers ranging from 0.0 (lowest) to 1.0 (highest), CLUTs are represented as gradients which are mapped to those heights. The lowest part of a gradient corresponds to the lowest part of the terrain, while the highest part of the gradient corresponds to the highest part of the terrain. Everything in between is evenly distributed. // TODO: Image In this example, you can see how the gradient from a CLUTer node maps to the heightfield. Now, if you take the same CLUT map, and use a FlowMap instead of using the height of the terrain as the input, you get a different type of texture output that follows the flow lines of the FlowMap output. Node Structure All color nodes (except Mixer) follow a simple structure: the main input port for mapping the CLUT, and the Visualization port for the 3D heightfield to use for the viewport. The latter is not necessary most of the time, but is recommended. Otherwise your input may not look accurate in the preview as it will just assume the first 3D node prior to this node is the heightfield.

    "keywords": "This documentation is a work-in-progress and subject to change. Understanding the Advanced Graph The graph may look complicated, but follows a simple pattern. Each node represents a specific function, and has two types of \"ports\"; namely, Input ports and Output ports. These ports are used to connect one node to another to create a sequence of functions, which result in a terrain. There are certain nodes that may not have both port types, or may have special ports specific to that node. For a better understanding of those nodes, please see the documentation for those specific nodes under Reference . Masking Masking is a very important part of creating sophisticated terrains. By default, when you apply an effect or process on a terrain, it is applied uniformly across the entire surface. By using the Mask port, you can contain the effect in a specific area. You can use any shape/terrain to mask a node, or you can draw it with Fluent Masking. Fluent Masking Fluent Masking allows you to paint a mask on your terrain. To create a Fluent Mask, click the Fluent Mask button in the node's Properties toolbar . This will enable the Fluent Mask mode, and give you a small masking toolbar to control the size and intensity of your brush stroke. You can paint on the terrain like you would in any paint program. Holding down the ALT key will erase the stroke. Once you are finished, click the \"End Masking\" button in the toolbar to commit the mask. Managing Nodes When a graph becomes large, there are many ways you can manage nodes for specific purposes. The options below are available through a keyboard shortcut or from the context menu of the node by right-click. Bypass Bypassing a node (press B ) keeps it in the graph, and maintains its relationships, but it is not included in the processing. This is very useful for experimentation. Pinned Preview Pinning a preview (press F ) is a convenient way to see the end-result of a chain of nodes. When a node is pinned, you can move to other nodes and see their properties; however, the visual is only that of the pinned node. If the pinned node is in the chain of nodes for which you are modifying properties, you will see the effect those changes have on the pinned node without having to move your focus. If you pin another node, the current pinned node is released. If you pin the same node again, it will release the pin. Pinned Visual Pinning the visual (press G ) is the same as a pinned preview, but it only works for Color nodes. When you fix the visual and move between different color production nodes, the color texture will change in concert with the node you select. However, the base heightfield upon which the texture is applied will be the Fixed Visual. If you move to a non-color node, it will show you its default preview. Mark for Save When a node is marked for save (press L ), it will emit the output as a file when the terrain is built. Any nodes that are marked for save will be available in the Build Manager. See the article Building for details. Using Convenience Tools Drop Behavior Drop a node on a connection to have it interject itself between two nodes. Drop it on another node to have it be parented to that node. If another sibling node exists, the new node will be organized automatically. Alternatively, you can drag an unconnected node, that already exists, on to a connection and it will interject itself. Auto Layout Even the most complicated graphs can be automatically organized. Just press F4 in the graph. Pressing F4 once will layout the graph in a linear pattern. Pressing F4 again lays out the graph in a waterfall pattern. In the waterfall pattern, Gaea will intelligently try to figure out the junctions in the graph and stagger the subsequence nodes accordingly. Quick Create Node Rather than setting up a node and then connecting it, you can drag a connection into empty space and use the quick create menu. Connect to Connection Drop a connection on another connection to quickly connect to the same source node. MultiMix Select two or more nodes, and click the MultiMix button. This will instantly create a sequence of Combine nodes to mix the selected nodes together. For more detailed control, you can select two at a time and MultiMix the results."

    "title": "Properties | QuadSpinner Gaea",
    "keywords": "This documentation is a work-in-progress and subject to change. Properties Every node exposes a set of properties or settings that you can modify to change the effect that node has on the terrain. When you select a node, the settings become available in the Properties panel in the right side of the interface. When you change a property, the effect is immediately applied and made visible in the viewport - except when dealing with Heavy Nodes (see below). Most nodes have a limited type of properties: Integer : such as 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc. They usually define quantity or a finite value like angle. Decimals : such as 0.1 , 0.256 , 0.4885 , etc. They usually define the strength or amount of a certain setting. In most cases, small changes can be quite powerful. Toggle : They usually allow you to turn a feature on or off. Choices : These take the form of a dropdown where you can select one of many options. Color : They allow you to choose a color for the color production nodes. File : They allow you to choose a file from your computer. Some nodes may have special controls specific to them, like the Directed Erosion . Tip One of the easiest ways to learn about a node's properties is to experiment, changing them to different values across the range to see the effect they have. Warning If a setting says something like \"Iteration\", \"Strength\", \"Cycles\", or \"Amount\", be cautious. High values may take longer to process. Microincrements The Microincrements panel is available when you right-click an Integer or Decimals property. With the Microincrements panel, you can achieve much higher precision in entering values: you can type a value; click a button to halve, double, increment (small or large); or reset the value. It also gives you access to a private Undo history for that particular setting. This history is cleared when you select a different node. Seed Reset Seed Reset is a minor enhancement in the Microincrements UI. It sets the “Default” seed value to whatever the random value is when the node is created. So if you play around for a while and want to go back to the original seed, you can simply reset the Seed. Heavy Nodes We have classified some nodes, such as Erosion , Fluvial , etc. as \"Heavy\" Nodes — meaning, they can take a long time to process, and sometimes cannot be cancelled mid-process. Updating multiple settings on such a node can slow down or even freeze up the application. When you modify a Heavy node, it will not update automatically. It will instead show an Apply button, which you can click when you have made your changes. If you move away from the node, or select another node, changes will be applied automatically, so you won’t lose any modifications. You can optionally turn on the manual node update for all nodes if you prefer, by turning off Automatically apply Node Modifications in the Preferences . If the setting is turned on, which is the default, only Heavy nodes will require manual updates. Post Processing The Post Process tab sits right under the Properties and provides quick access to common functions. You can use Autolevel and Influence to control your node without having to add a second node. This will help you keep your graph clean. The Influence slider is a very simple yet powerful tool for layering effects. It blends the output back with the input, allowing you to manage the influence of the current node. // TODO: Image Here is an example: a heavily eroded terrain goes through Recurve, but in Recurve the Influence is set to 0.5 , which yields a more realistic looking output of Recurve, while being able to use strong values in Recurve to create long striations."

When you work on a terrain, and especially when you export, the amount of detail in the final result is calculated based on the size or resolution of the export image. Even if you export as a mesh, the image resolution is critical. In Gaea, there are two different resolutions you work with: the preview resolution and the export resolution. Preview Resolution The Preview Resolution controls the quality of detail of your terrain preview in the viewport. You can choose between 512 x 512 (0.5K) to 4096 x 4096 (4K) resolution in cubic increments of 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096. Warning The higher the resolution, the more detail you will get. However, larger resolutions can take 4x more time to process the image. Switch to higher resolutions only when you need to. You can switch between preview resolutions as often as you like. When you switch the resolution, the terrain preview is rebuilt. For 0.5K and 1K previews, the process is usually fast. For 2K and 4K, it can take longer. Tip The Preferences have an option to force any file to a 512 preview resolution when opening. This allows the \"first-build\" to be very fast and you can always change to a higher resolution. If you start with a high resolution, you have to wait until it is finished before you can do anything. This option is on by default to prevent such lockouts, but you can turn it off if you prefer. Export Resolution The Export Resolution controls the quality of detail in your built/exported terrains. In Gaea, there is no limit on maximum resolution except for what your hardware allows. By default, you can export to resolutions of 1024; 2048; 4096; 8192; 16,384 (16K); and 32,768 (32K). Tip For resolutions beyond 16K, we recommend using Tiled Builds to contend with unlimited resolutions on even modest hardware. As with preview resolutions, high export resolutions can also take much longer than the preview - something to be expected with builds. In essence, you create a \"template\" with your settings when you create a terrain at preview resolutions. When you \"build\" a terrain, Gaea takes that preview template and uses those settings to build the terrain from scratch using the full export resolution. This results in more detail than is possible in previews. For more information on building terrains, see Build Manager ."

If you're a casual terrain artist, this won't affect your workflow too much — the defaults will be sufficient. But if you're creating precisely scaled terrains, the Terrain Definition is your best friend. Terrain Definition The Terrain Definition popup is found in the main toolbar. You can define the Base and Height of your terrain in meters. Both are counted from sea level (0.0m). The Scale determines the extent of the entire terrain. By default, Gaea terrains are set at sea level (Base: 0m), just over 3km tall (Height: 3,200m), and 5 x 5 square kilometers wide (Scale: 5,000m). // Internally, the terrain scale calculation is performed like this: (height / scale) - base A height of 3km is usually more than enough for most terrains. Mt. Everest is 8.8km tall! Going that tall is not recommended unless you really know how to handle the side effects of such tall terrains. Note: Terrain Definition is non-destructive. You can scale your terrain and the update will be applied on the fly without requiring a rebuild of your terrain. You can change the values as often as you like. Full Range vs. Clamped The new Output node is the primary way to save your output. It automatically saves the specified file when a full Build is initiated from the Export panel. By default, it exports Clamped values, but you can choose to export a Full Range map by enabling Full Range in the Output node's properties. What's the difference? Here you can see the two outputs: Clamped and Full Range. The main difference is that Clamped is limited to the height set in the Terrain Definition, while Full Range ignores both the Base and Height settings, and exports the entire gradient range in its natural form (32-bit floating point). When should I use Full Range? Most of the time, you won't need to use Full Range. It can be useful in rare cases: when you intend to manually scale the terrain vertically later; or when you want to manually edit or sculpt the terrain in Photoshop, ZBrush or Mudbox and need as much detail as possible. If you do use the Full Range export, it is best to use the OpenEXR (.exr) format to preserve the values as best as possible. You can always export a copy with Clamped values, and use that as a guide for vertically resizing the externally edited Full Range output."

    "title": "Build Swarm | QuadSpinner Gaea",
    "keywords": "This documentation is a work-in-progress and subject to change. Build Swarm Warning Using the Build Swarm manually or through automation is recommended for advanced users only. The Build Swarm is the command line building engine for Gaea. Whenever a large scale build is needed, Gaea launches the Build Swarm to build the terrain. You can also launch it manually if needed. The Build Swarm can be found in the Gaea installation folder as Gaea.Build.exe . The Build Swarm writes status messages to StdOut and can be monitored remotely if needed. You MUST use the --silent argument when capturing StdOut data otherwise it may overload your application and slow down the build itself. Command Line Arguments Note Gaea uses double dashes -- instead of a single dash for command line arguments. For paths, always encapsulate them in double quotes to avoid path truncation. Example Command Line: \"C:\\Program Files\\QuadSpinner\\Gaea\\Gaea.Build.exe\" \"C:\\Users\\Me\\Documents\\Gaea\\MyFile.tor\" --silent - Disables all non-essential console output. --savetor - Saves a copy of the current file in the build folder. --open - Opens the build folder after the build is complete. The following functionality is scheduled for inclusion soon. --path PATH - Override the destination path for the build. PATH must be a legal, non-write-protected path supplied in double quotes. Gaea will attempt to create the folder if possible. --var(foo, bar) - Override the value (bar) of a node property (foo) that has been exposed in the file. --format EXT - Override the default output format. Allowed values are PNG, EXR, PSD, HDR, TIF, RAW. Must be entered in CAPITALS. --variant N - Repeats the build and randomizes the seeds of every node for each build to create variations. Variations are stored in own sub-folder named in the pattern of Var1, Var2, etc. Batch Building You can run a batch build by executing a batch (.bat) file as shown below. REM Change drive, just to be sure C: REM Go to the Gaea install folder cd %programfiles%\\QuadSpinner\\Gaea SET vars = --silent --savetor REM List all files to build in quotes Gaea.Build.exe \"C:\\Users\\Dax\\Documents\\Gaea\\ErosionB-001.tor\" vars Gaea.Build.exe \"C:\\Users\\Dax\\Documents\\Gaea\\ErosionB-002.tor\" vars Gaea.Build.exe \"C:\\Users\\Dax\\Documents\\Gaea\\ErosionB-003.tor\" vars Gaea.Build.exe \"C:\\Users\\Dax\\Documents\\Gaea\\ErosionB-004.tor\" vars Gaea.Build.exe \"C:\\Users\\Dax\\Documents\\Gaea\\ErosionB-005.tor\" vars Gaea.Build.exe \"C:\\Users\\Dax\\Documents\\Gaea\\ErosionB-006.tor\" vars Gaea.Build.exe \"C:\\Users\\Dax\\Documents\\Gaea\\ErosionB-007.tor\" vars Gaea.Build.exe \"C:\\Users\\Dax\\Documents\\Gaea\\ErosionB-008.tor\" vars Gaea.Build.exe \"C:\\Users\\Dax\\Documents\\Gaea\\ErosionB-009.tor\" vars Tip In the future, you will be able to drag and drop multiple files on Gaea.Build.exe to run a batch build.

    "title": "Building Terrains | QuadSpinner Gaea",
    "keywords": "This documentation is a work-in-progress and subject to change. Building Terrains The output from your project must be saved to a file in order to use it elsewhere. To do this, you must build the output. When you build the output, Gaea will create it at your target resolution. This may take a while to build depending on the complexity of your terrain, and the effects used. This image shows the Build Swarm building your terrain project. Over the course of a complex project, saving and managing the appropriate outputs can become a tedious task. Managing outputs for several different nodes, especially those with multiple outputs like the Erosion node, can make it even worse. The Build Manager simplifies how builds are saved, organized, and managed for future use. Mark for Save Instead of creating a dedicated \"Output\" node and then specifying the file to save, you can mark a node for automatic output. To mark a node for saving, right-click the node and select Save. You can also use the Graph Toolbar button. In the Layers Workflow you can right-click a layer in the Layers List. Once a node is marked for saving, it displays this icon underneath the node. The Build Manager You can choose the file format to use for all outputs, modify a node's output name by clicking on the node's label, choose unclamped (formerly called \"Full Range\"), and +1 output (where 512 x 512 becomes 513 x 513 — necessary for some game engines). You can also use the Build Manager for version control and file organization. Version Control and Organization Organizing Builds The Location field in the Build Manager provides two built-in options for storing your builds. The first option is the central build repository, which is stored in My Documents\\Gaea\\Builds[Filename] by default, but can be changed to any location — even to a local network or an online shared folder with OneDrive, Dropbox, GDrive, etc. This can be useful in team situations. The other option is to have it stored alongside the file in a Builds folder. So if your file is called MyTerrain.tor, a folder called MyTerrain_Builds will be placed next to it. In both cases, inside the Builds folder, a subfolder with the build timestamp is created. The build output files, a build.info file, and the .tor copy are stored inside this subfolder. Example paths Central Repository: C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\Gaea\\Builds\\EastRiver\\2018–06–22_22–55–31\\ Local File: D:\\Work\\Terrains\\EastRiver_Builds\\2018–06–22_21–55–31\\ But these are not the only options. You can explicitly specify a location instead of choosing a template, or you can create your own combinations using an absolute path and variables such as: [FileLocation] Location of the currently open file. [Builds] Central build repository. [Filename] Name of the current file without extension. [Resolution] Current resolution (eg. 8192). [Timestamp] Sortable timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS format. [Username] Your local network identity. [Machine] Your local network machine name. So you could create your own path template such as: [Builds]\\[Filename]\\[Timestamp]\\[Resolution]\\ — which would create ~\\Documents\\Gaea\\Builds\\EastRiver\\2018–06–22_21–55–31\\8192\\ or something more specific such as: \\\\00.00.00.00\\Team\\Terrains\\[Username]_[Timestamp]\\ which would create \\\\00.00.00\\Team\\Terrains\\Bob_2018–06–22–55–31\\ Version Controlling Terrains Gaea's Build Manager and Build Stack give you low level version control without additional overhead. The \"Save copy of .TOR\" option is useful when you want to manage different versions of your actual project file. When turned on, every time your build finishes, a copy of the .tor file in the exact state of that particular build is stored alongside the build output. You can easily go back to any older build state for your file, and save it as new file. You can also map the folder to almost any modern version control system (Git, Mercurial, Visual Studio Team Services, etc.), or share on a network folder with your team.
