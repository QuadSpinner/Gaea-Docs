This means that a 512 x 512 preview build will maintain essential parity for all major erosion features with a high resolution 4K or 8K build. You no longer need to guess the output type. The algorithm also creates exquisite flows with naturalistic curves that have never been seen in digital erosion before."

The Create phase requires you to use nodes that are known as Primitives. In normal 3D applications, we are used to primitives such as box, sphere, plane, and so on. In Gaea, a primitive is a basic element of a terrain. For example, Mountain and Dunes are two examples of geological elements. // TODO: Image The Modify phase requires you to take the basic primitive shape and make it more natural by adding filters and erosion. An example of this would be adding a Terrace node to create even stratification on the terrain, and then adding the Erosion node to add natural erosion. // TODO: Image The Export phase is the easiest. You take the last node in your graph and mark it for saving, then build it using the Build Manager . // TODO: Image Choosing your Workflow Gaea provides two different workflows for creating terrains. You can choose either based on your needs, and you can even switch between the two while working on the terrain. Layers // TODO: Image Layers are a deceptively simple way to craft terrains. You can stack nodes like Photoshop® layers. This is a great way to quickly prototype a terrain or explore different ideas, without worrying about managing nodes. Layers are limited with one-to-one relationships, unlike a graph which can have a one-to-many relationships where you can create two different \"chains\" of creation and blend them together in myriad ways. Read more about this workflow in the Layers Workflow section. Graph // TODO: Image The Graph provides a sophisticated workflow that is very flexible. Like any other graph based workflow, you get both simple and complex functions packed into nodes which you can connect to each other to create a network which produces a terrain. Read more about this workflow in the Graph Mode section Next steps Familiarize yourself with the different tools and interfaces available in Gaea in Getting around , and start exploring some of the Quickstarts examples to see how terrains can be made."

While Ventral uses partially randomized, churning forces to erode the terrain, Lateral concentrates on following the flow and creating patterns based on how water flows over and around obstacles. Ventral works with two sets of forces: the macro force and the micro force, both interweaving to use the shape of the terrain to drive the erosion. This erosion method uses horizontal flow mechanics unlike the hydraulicy erosion resulting in an output that speaks of flowing waters gently carving the terrain over thousands of year. Setting Values Description Power 0.00 - 1.00 Higher values cause larger, smoother shapes and decay fine details. Lower values preserve details but create slightly rougher curves. Multiplier 1 - 10 Higher values will cause the erosion to erase smaller features in the terrain by creating stronger flows. Form Lateral Ventral"

If you're a casual terrain artist, this won't affect your workflow too much — the defaults will be sufficient. But if you're creating precisely scaled terrains, the Terrain Definition is your best friend. Terrain Definition The Terrain Definition popup is found in the main toolbar. You can define the Base and Height of your terrain in meters. Both are counted from sea level (0.0m). The Scale determines the extent of the entire terrain. By default, Gaea terrains are set at sea level (Base: 0m), just over 3km tall (Height: 3,200m), and 5 x 5 square kilometers (Scale: 5,000m) wide. // Internally, the terrain scale calculation is performed like this: (height / scale) - base 3km is usually more than enough for most terrains. Mt. Everest is 8.8km tall! Going that tall is not recommended unless you really know how to handle the side effects of such tall terrains. Note: Terrain Definition is non-destructive. You can scale your terrain, and the update will be applied on the fly without requiring a rebuild of your terrain. You can change the values as often as you like. Full Range vs. Clamped The new Output node is the primary way to save your output. It automatically saves the specified file when a full Build is initiated from the Export panel. By default, it exports Clamped values, but you can choose to export a Full Range map by enabling Full Range in the Output node's properties. What's the difference? Here you can see the two outputs: Clamped and Full Range. The main difference is that Clamped is limited to the height set in the Terrain Definition, while Full Range ignores both the Base and Height settings, and exports the entire gradient range in its natural form (32-bit floating point). When should I use Full Range? Most of the time, you won't need to use it. Rare cases where it is useful is when you intend to manually scale the terrain vertically later; or you want to manually edit or sculpt the terrain in Photoshop, ZBrush or Mudbox and need as much detail as possible. If you do use the Full Range export, it is best to use the OpenEXR (.exr) format to preserve the values as best as possible. You can always export a copy with clamped values, and use that as a guide for vertically resizing the externally edited Full Range output."

While Selector masks generally represent an area or selection such as slope, angle, or curvature, Data Maps represent a specific type of data of the area: such as water flow, soil deposits, etc. Data Maps are very useful for creating color maps. For example, the water flow can be used to create a Biome texture, or used manually with a CLUTer or SatMaps node to create a texture along water flow areas. A basic texture with Data Maps In this example, we create a simple terrain using a Mountain node, then eroding it to get some basic erosion data. On top of the eroded output, we apply a Soil Map node. The Soil Map node is fed to a SatMaps node to create a base texture for the terrain. The Flow and Wear output of the Erosion node are mixed and fed to another SatMaps node to create a second map. The two maps are mixed together to create the final texture. // TODO: Image See the Quickstarts for more color production examples."

    "keywords": "This documentation is a work-in-progress and subject to change. Understanding the Advanced Graph The graph may look complicated, but follows a simple pattern. Each node represents a specific function, and has two types of \"ports\", namely Input ports and Output ports. These ports are used to connect one node to another to create a sequence of functions, which result in a terrain. There are certain nodes which may not have all the port types, or may have special ports specific to that node. For better understanding of those nodes, please see the documentation for those specific nodes under the Reference . Masking Masking is a very important part of creating sophisticated terrains. By default, when you apply an effect or process on a terrain, it is applied uniformly across the entire surface. By using the Mask port, you can contain the effect into a specific area. You can use any shape/terrain to mask a node, or you can draw it with Fluent Masking. Fluent Masking Fluent Masking allows you to paint a mask on your terrain. To create a Fluent Mask, click the Fluent Mask button in the node's Properties toolbar . This will enable the Fluent Mask mode, and give you a small masking toolbar to control the size and intensity of your brush stroke. You can paint on the terrain like you would in any paint program. Holding down the ALT key will erase the stroke. Once you are finished, click the \"End Masking\" button in the toolbar to commit the mask. Managing Nodes When a graph becomes large, there are many ways you can manage nodes for specific purposes. The options below are available through a keyboard shortcut or from the context menu of the node by right-click. Bypass Bypassing a node (press B ) keeps it in the graph, and maintains its relationships, but it is not included in the processing. This is very useful for experimentation. Pinned Preview Pinning a preview (press F ) is a good way to see the end-result of a chain of nodes. When a node is pinned, you can move to other nodes and see their properties, however the visual is that of the pinned node only. If the pinned node is in the chain of nodes for whom you are modifying properties, you will see the effect those changes have on the pinned node without having to move your focus. If you pin another node, the current pinned node is released. If you pin the same node again, it will release the pin. Pinned Visual Pinning the visual (press G ) is the same as a pinned preview, however it only works for Color nodes. When you fix the visual, and move between different color production nodes, the color texture will change in concert with the node you select, however the base heightfield upon which the texture is applied will be the Fixed Visual. If you move to a non-color node, it will show you its default preview. Mark for Save When a node is marked for saving (press L ), it will emit the output as a file when the terrain is built. Any nodes marked for saving will be available in the Build Manager. See the article Building for details. Using Convenience Tools Drop Behavior Drop a node on a connection to have it interject itself between two nodes. Drop it on another node and have it be parented to that node. If another sibling node exists, the new node will organized automatically. Alternatively, you can drag an unconnected node that already exists on to a connection, and it will interject itself. Auto Layout Even the most complicated graphs can be automatically organized. Just press F4 in the graph. Pressing F4 once will layout the graph in a linear pattern. Pressing F4 again lays out the graph in a waterfall pattern. In the waterfall pattern, Gaea will intelligently try and figure out the junctions in the graph and stagger the subsequence nodes accordingly. Quick Create Node Rather than setting up a node and then connecting it, you can drag a connection into empty space and use the quick create menu. Connect to Connection Drop a connection on another connection to quickly connect to the same source node. MultiMix Select two or more nodes, and click the MultiMix button to instantly create a sequence of Combine nodes to mix the selected nodes together. For more detailed control, you can select two at a time and MultiMix the results."

Bleeding Edge Engine Requires DirectX 11 compatible hardware The Bleeding Edge engine uses modern hardware and software capabilities to provide extremely detailed views of your terrains. It does this at additional GPU expense, but provides the best visuals. The Bleeding Edge engine can show previews of up to 16K resolution. Standard Engine The Standard engine is made for compatibility and will work great across both modern and older hardware. It can visualize up to 8K resolution terrains, but high resolution previews are the expense of minor visual fidelity. Map Viewer The Map Viewer provides flat, 2D previews with pixel-to-pixel accuracy. In some situations, you can see visual data that may not be readily visible in the 3D viewport. The Map Viewer also provides options to visualize primary output in both 2D and shaded 2D views, and secondary output as flat images or overlays on the primary output."

    "keywords": "This documentation is a work-in-progress and subject to change. Resolutions This is one of the central precepts of terrain design. When you work on, and especially when you export, the terrain the amount of detail in the final result is calculated based on the size or resolution of the export image. Even if you export as a mesh, the image resolution is critical. In Gaea, there are two different resolutions you work with: the preview resolution, and the export resolution. Preview Resolution The Preview Resolution controls the quality of detail of your terrain preview in the viewport. You can choose between 512 x 512 (0.5K) to 4096 x 4096 (4K) resolution in cubic increments of 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096. Warning The higher the resolution, the more detail you will get. However larger resolutions can take 4x more time to process the image. Switch to higher resolutions only when you need to. You can switch between preview resolutions as often as you like. When you switch the resolution, the terrain preview is rebuilt. For 0.5K and 1K previews, this is usually a fast process. For 2K and 4K, it can take longer. Tip The Preferences have an option to force any file to a 512 preview resolution when opening. This prevents the \"first-build\" to be very fast and you can always change to a higher resolution. If you start with a high resolution, you have to wait until it is finished before you can do anything. This option is on by default to prevent such lockouts, but you can turn it off if you prefer. Export Resolution The Export Resolution controls the quality of detail in your built/exported terrains. In Gaea, there is no limit for the maximum resolution except what is capable with your hardware. By default, you can export to resolutions of 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16,384 (16K), and 32,768 (32K). Tip For resolutions beyond 16K, we recommend using Tiled Builds as they can contend with unlimited resolutions on even modest hardware. As with preview resolutions, high export resolutions can also take much longer than the preview, but that is to be expected with builds. In essence, you create a \"template\" with your settings when you create a terrain at preview resolutions. When you \"build\" a terrain, Gaea takes the template of your preview, and uses those settings to build the terrain from scratch using the full export resolution. This results in more detail than is possible in previews. For more information on building terrains, see Build Manager ."

When you select a node, the settings become available in the Properties panel in the right side of the interface. When you change a property, the effect is immediately applied and made visible in the viewport - except when dealing with Heavy Nodes (see below). There are mostly a limited type of properties for all nodes: Integer : such as 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc. They usually define quantity or a finite value like angle. Decimals : such as 0.1 , 0.256 , 0.4885 , etc. They usually define the strength or amount of a certain setting. In most cases, small changes can be quite powerful. Toggle : They usually allow you to turn a feature on or off. Choices : These take the form of a dropdown where you can select one of many options. Color : They allow you to choose a color for the color production nodes. File : They allow you to choose a file from your computer. Some nodes may have special controls specific to them, like the @Directed-Erosione-Node. Note Dragging always sucks up more CPU power than clicking because each movement of the drag cancels the pending process of the terrain and fires up a new process. If you drag slowly, this can mean anything between dozens to hundreds of reprocess threads. Tip One of the easiest ways to learn about a node's properties is to try changing them to different values across the range to see the effect they have. Warning If a setting says something like \"Iteration\", \"Strength\", \"Cycles\", or \"Amount\", be cautious. High values may take longer to process. Microincrements The Microincrements panel is available when you right-click an Integer or Decimals property. With the Microincrements panel, you can achieve much higher precision in entering values: you can type a value; click a button to halve, double, increment (small or large); or reset the value. It also gives you access to a private Undo history for that particular setting. This history is cleared when you select a different node. Seed Reset Seed Reset is a minor enhancement in the microincrements UI. It sets the “Default” seed value to whatever the random value is when the node is created. So if you play around for a while and want to go back to the original seed, you can simply reset the Seed. Heavy Nodes We have classified some nodes, such as Erosion , Fluvial , etc. as \"Heavy\" nodes — meaning, they can take a long time to process, and sometimes cannot be cancelled mid-process. Updating multiple settings on such a node can slow down or even freeze up the application. When you modify a Heavy node, it will not update automatically. It will instead show an Apply button, which you can click when you have made your changes. If you move away from the node, or select another node, changes will be applied automatically, so you won’t lose any modifications. You can optionally turn on the manual node update for all nodes if you prefer, by turning off Automatically apply Node Modifications in the Preferences . If the setting is turned on, which is the default, only Heavy nodes will require manual updates. Post Processing The Post Process tab sits right under the Properties, and provides quick access to common functions. In this release, we have added a limit set of common functions, but more will be added later once certain under-the-hood changes are complete. You can use autolevel and influence to control your node without having to add a second node. This will help you keep your graph clean. The Influence slider is a very simple yet powerful tool for layering effects. It blends the output back with the input, allowing you to manage the influence of the current node. // TODO: Image Here is an example: a heavily eroded terrain goes through Recurve, but in Recurve, the influence is set to 0.5 , which gives us a more realistic looking output of Recurve, while being able to use strong values in Recurve to create long striations."

    "keywords": "This documentation is a work-in-progress and subject to change. Understanding Directed Erosion Directed Erosion works in its own \"Sculpt mode\". In this example, we have a simple setup at 512 x 512 preview resolution. When you add the Directed Erosion node, you will notice it has its own independent resolution. In most cases, this should be the final output resolution. See the Strategies section later in this article for more details. Directed Erosion is meant for fine detailing, and works at an independent resolution from the preview and final build resolutions. This Sculpt Resolution is then up or downscaled as needed. The Pros and Cons of Directed Erosion Working in 1:1 Resolution In an effort to prevent memory excesses, the Sculpt mode will only show a 2048 x 2048 area. The mini map in the sidebar let's you navigate the entire terrain, but you can only see a 2K area in the viewport at a time. Regardless of your target size, Directed Erosion's strokes are always processed at the same speed whether at 2K or 32K! Erosion Tools The Erosion Tool becomes available when you enter the Sculpt mode. This floating window lets you select an erosion tool, modify its setting, and choose an erosion mode. Each erosion tool creates a different effect, and some have secondary variations. LandBreaker - general, all purpose erosive breakdown. Flowlines - create Breaker style broad flow lines. Soil - soil deposit tool. Great with Infinite Flow. WideFlow - creates wide, long flows. Carver - strong, rock carving. Use sparingly! Gullies - create gentle, flowing gullies. Pockmarks - creates small impact holes. Use for detailing. Rocks - creates rock flows. Great with Infinite Flow. RoughFlow - chaotic soil/rock flows. Roughness - detailing tool for roughening surfaces. Scratch - detailing tool for creating superficial scratches. Sedimentary - strong soil flows. Properties While properties differ between some tools, there is a general pattern: Size - the size of your tool's impact area. Do note that this is the impact area, where the effect begins, but if your tool's effect generates erosive flows, they will go beyond the impact area. (That's the beauty of Directed Erosion - its not just simple masking.) Duration - this is the effect simulation duration. Be careful when using long duration values as it can take quite some time. Get a feel for the tools before modifying this value too much. Power - this is the strength of the erosion simulation. In most cases, you should leave it as-is. When using Infinite Flow, you can increase this value without too much penalty. In Normal or Erosive modes, it can shatter the terrain and create bad debris artifacts. Flow Distance - this is how far erosive flows should reach beyond the impact area. The longer the flow, the more processing it will require. Soil vs Rocks - the granularity of the erosive material. Low values create soft soil, while high values create rocks and boulders. Erosion Mode Normal Flow - this is the default mode where erosion behaves normally. Erosion will both take away material from your terrain and deposit it elsewhere. Infinite Flow - in this mode, erosive debris/material is deposited but never removed. It is great for adding soil, talus, and other material without taking away from your terrain. In other words, it generates soil and rocks from thin air. Erosive Flow - in this mode the effect is the exact opposite of the Infinite Flow where material is taken away, but nothing is deposited. You can keep eroding an area without created deposits downstream. Undo The Erosion Tool panel provides a local \"in-session\" undo function accessible next to the tools. You can undo up to 20 tool impacts. Sculpting When Sculpt mode is active, you cursor in the viewport becomes shows the impact area. The cursor flows over the terrain to show you the flow conditions and impact extents - very useful with large brush sizes. Click anywhere on the terrain to create a \"stroke\" using the selected tool. In this case, we use the Landbreaker tool to create a few random strokes. You will notice that while the base terrain uses the preview resolution (512 x 512), the strokes and their effects on the terrain are at your sculpt's target resolution (2048 x 2048). This lets you preview the effect your final build will have no matter what your preview quality. Once you are satisfied with your sculpt, turn the Sculpt mode off. You will notice that your high resolution sculpt is downscaled to the preview resolution, and may lose a lot of the detail. Once you are satisfied with your sculpt, turn the Sculpt mode off. You will notice that your high resolution sculpt is downscaled to the preview resolution, and may lose a lot of the detail. Once you are satisfied with your sculpt, turn the Sculpt mode off. You will notice that your high resolution sculpt is downscaled to the preview resolution, and may lose a lot of the detail. If we switch the preview resolution to 2048 x 2048, the Directed Erosion node will reprocess the strokes and show them with higher fidelity. <!--tip--> Use late in the workflow Directed Erosion becomes moot if you process your terrain greatly. So we recommend using it late in your graph after all the major shape changes are complete. It will save you hassles in the long run. Use in a separate file A great way to separate the impact of Directed Erosion from the rest of your graph is to save the output from your Graph, load that output in a new file using the File node, and then apply Directed Erosion to it. <!--/tip-->"

    "keywords": "This documentation is a work-in-progress and subject to change. Building Terrains The output from your Graph must be saved to a file in order to use it elsewhere. To do this, you must build the output. When you build the output, Gaea will create it at your target resolution. This may take a while to build depending on the complexity of your graph, and the effects used. Over the course of a complex project, saving and managing the appropriate outputs becomes a tedious ordeal. Managing outputs for many different nodes, especially those with multiple outputs such as the Erosion node, makes it even worse. The Build Manager simplifies how builds are saved, organized, and managed for future use. Mark for Save Instead of creating a dedicated \"Output\" node and then specifying the file to save, you can mark a node for automatic output. Just right-click any node and select \"Save\". Instead of creating a dedicated \"Output\" node and then specifying the file to save, you can mark a node for automatic output. Just right-click any node and select \"Save\". The Build Manager Now when you click Build, instead of firing off a build directly, you will see the Build Manager. The Build Manager gives you easy access to crucial output preferences. The node grid shows you all the nodes marked for output. You can temporarily toggle a node by clicking the color circle in the top left corner of the node. This does not affect the build, only the output. This can be useful when you only want to see a few specific outputs, or need to go back to rebuild an older project for selective output. When a node has multiple outputs, such as the Erosion or Breaker nodes in this example, you can individually toggle which ports should be saved as files. You can choose the file format to use for all outputs, modify a node's output name by clicking on the node's label, choose unclamped (formerly called \"Full Range\"), and +1 output(where 512 x 512 becomes 513 x 513 — necessary for some game engines). You can also use the Build Manager for version control and file organization. Version Control and Organization Organizing Builds The Location field in the Build Manager provides two built-in options for storing your builds. The first option is the central build repository, which is stored in My Documents\\Gaea\\Builds[Filename] by default, but can be changed to any location — even on a local network or an online shared folder with OneDrive, Dropbox, GDrive, etc. This can be useful in team situations. The other option is to have it stored alongside the file in a Builds folder. So if your file is called MyTerrain.tor, a folder called MyTerrain_Builds will be placed next to it. In both cases, inside the Builds folder, a subfolder with the build timestamp is created. The build output files, a build.info file, and the .tor copy are stored inside this subfolder. Example paths Central Repository: C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\Gaea\\Builds\\EastRiver\\2018–06–22_22–55–31\\ Local File: D:\\Work\\Terrains\\EastRiver_Builds\\2018–06–22_21–55–31\\ But these are not the only options. You can explicitly specify a location instead of choosing a template, or create your own combinations using an absolute path and variables such as: [FileLocation] Location of the currently open file. [Builds] Central build repository. [Filename] Name of the current file without extension. [Resolution] Current resolution (eg. 8192). [Timestamp] Sortable timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS format. [Username] Your local network identity. [Machine] Your local network machine name. So you could create your own path template such as: [Builds]\\[Filename]\\[Timestamp]\\[Resolution]\\ — which would create ~\\Documents\\Gaea\\Builds\\EastRiver\\2018–06–22_21–55–31\\8192\\ or something more specific such as: \\\\00.00.00.00\\Team\\Terrains\\[Username]_[Timestamp]\\ which would create \\\\00.00.00\\Team\\Terrains\\Bob_2018–06–22–55–31\\ Version Controlling Terrains Gaea's Build Manager and Build Stack give you low level version control without additional overhead. The \"Save copy of .TOR\" option is useful when you want to manage different versions of your actual project file. When turned on, every time your build finishes, a copy of the .tor file in the exact state of that particular build is stored alongside the build output. You can easily go back to any older build state for your file, save it as new file. You can also map the folder to almost any modern version control system (Git, Mercurial, Visual Studio Team Services, etc.), or share on a network folder with your team."

As a 2D heightfields are essentially a grid of number ranging from 0.0 (lowest) to 1.0 (highest), CLUTs are represented as gradients which are mapped to those heights. The lowest part of a gradient corresponds to the lowest part of the terrain, while the highest part of the gradient corresponds to the highest part of the terrain. Everything in between is evenly distributed. In this example, you can see how the gradient from a CLUTer node maps to the heightfield. Node Structure All color nodes (except Mixer) follow a simple structure: the main input port for mapping the CLUT, and the Visualization port for the 3D heightfield to use for the viewport. Now, if you take the same CLUT map, and instead of using the height of the terrain as the input, use a FlowMap instead, you get a different type of texture output that follows the flow lines of the FlowMap output. The latter is not necessary most of the time, but is recommended. Otherwise your input may not look accurate in the preview as it will just assume the first 3D node prior to this node is the heightfield.
