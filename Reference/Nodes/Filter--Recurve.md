nRecurve is a curvature based expander node. It can inflate and/or deflate the terrain to create stronger slopes and larger, softer formations from a given noise or terrain.

### Additional Info

Recurve's output may not look like it, but it is a very sensitive to subtle changes in the source heightfield. For example, if prior to Recurve, you apply Microerosion or Breaker, then Recurve will create a very specific flow patterning on those grooves and valleys.
