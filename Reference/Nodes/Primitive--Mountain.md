nThe Mountain is one of the most versatile primitives in Gaea. It uses a modulated Voronoi pattern and distortions to create realistic mountain shape, ready for further modification and erosion.

### Additional Info

For simple results, such as distance mountains that don't require too much detail, you can create a mountain primitive with a scale of your choice and add the Erosion node. This is the easiest way to create lot of simple assets.
