nFusion is a hybrid of slope erosion, vertical terracing, and thermal erosion. It addresses the challenge of creating interesting slopes in steep areas. Fusion adapts thermal erosion by producing modular talus.


| Setting        | Values     | Description                                                                                      |
| :------------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Iterations** | 1 - 500    | The number of erosion iterations to perform on the terrain.                                      |
| **Talus**      | 6 - 89     | The angle at which erosion should begin.                                                         |
| **Deviation**  | 0 - 20     | The variation (+/-) to the Talus angle. This is great for creating non-uniform collapsed plates. |
| **Seed**       | 0 - 128000 | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process.                                        |


### Additional Info

Fusion further adds slanted terracing to convey terrain folding and collapsed plates.
