nConstant is perhaps the simplest node in Gaea. It creates a uniform, blank terrain of the height specified.

| Setting    | Values      | Description                      |
| :--------- | :---------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Height** | 0.00 - 1.00 | The height of the blank terrain. |



By itself, Constant is rarely useful. It is often used with Combine to blend a shape with a "zero terrain" using a mask.
