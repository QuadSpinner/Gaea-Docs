nThe stark form of erosion is breakage, encapsulated in the form of Stratifier. This erosion method allows you to stratify the terrain in a non-linear fashion. Unlike terracing, Stratification involves substrata/subterraces created in confined local zones, such as between two broken plates. Each stratified layer exists independent from the rest of the layer, creating a robust, realistic formation.

| Setting       | Values      | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------ | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strength**  | 0.00 - 0.30 | The amount of stratification to be applied. Low values produce more strata, with fractured, delicate substrata; high values produce stronger, larger strata. |
| **Substrata** | 0.00 - 1.00 | At non-zero values, creates a secondary level of stratification between the first level of stratification for added detail.                                  |
| **Filtered**  | On / Off    | When ON, creates smoother curvature for the plates.                                                                                                          |
