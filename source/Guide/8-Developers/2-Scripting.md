# GaeaFx Scripting

GaeaFx Scripting is an extremely easy way to create complex solutions right inside Gaea.

Gaea is scripted using the Script node and our own proprietary scripting language called TorScript.

TorScript is loosely based on C# and should be very accessible to anyone who has a basic knowledge of C#, C/C++, JavaScript, Java, or similar languages.

TorScript uses minimal syntax which makes it easy for a complete programming novice to start scripting.
