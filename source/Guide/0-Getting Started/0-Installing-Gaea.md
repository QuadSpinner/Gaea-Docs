## Software Requirements
- Microsoft [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/net48) or later.
- Microsoft [Visual C++ 2017 Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

## Normal Install
Installing Gaea is a simple process. Depending on your installation location, you may need administrative privileges.

1. Download the [latest version](https://quadspinner.com/gaea/download).
2. Run the downloaded .exe file.
3. By default, Gaea installs to `C:\Program Files\QuadSpinner\Gaea` but can be directed to any other folder. For security purposes, we recommend the `C:\Program Files` folder.
4. Once setup is complete, Gaea will launch.
5. Follow the on-screen questions to set up your default preferences.
6. The Gaea central project repository and build stacks are placed in `Documents\Gaea\` by default. However, you can change this folder to any other location through installer, or at any later time via the Preferences.
