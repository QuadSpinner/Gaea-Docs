## Startup Issues

### If Gaea fails to start

- Ensure `Gaea.exe` and `Archon.exe` have firewall permissions for local TCP/IP communication.
- Install the latest CPU and GPU drivers.
- Ensure you have at least 10GB of free space in your Windows' temp directory, as well as the cache folder set in Gaea Preferences.

If none of these work, run @watson and file a ticket. Our support team will help you figure out the problem.
