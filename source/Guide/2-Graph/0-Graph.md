## The Infinity Graph

Gaea's advanced graph based workflow is the key to creating sophisticated terrains. This open-ended workflow gives you the flexibility to create almost any kind of results that you want.

{.NOTE}
> If you have not used node based workflows before, it may look intimidating but Gaea provides a very artist friendly workflow where you are not required to create complex graphs to get good results. Try following some of the simple exercises like @first-terrain or the @tutorials section, and you will see that the graph is quite easy to use. @conveniences further enhance the way you create and manage nodes, making it easy to try different things.

The Infinity Graph allows you to split your terrain graph across multiple tabs using @portals.
