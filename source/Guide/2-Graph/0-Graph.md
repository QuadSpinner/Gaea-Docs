## The Infinity Graph

Gaea's advanced graph based workflow is the key to creating sophisticated terrains. This open-ended workflow gives you the flexibility to create almost any kind of results that you want.

{.NOTE}
> If you have not used node based workflows before, it may look intimidating but Gaea provides a very artist friendly workflow where you are not required to create complex graphs to get good results. Try following some of the simple exercises like @first-terrain or the @techniques section, and you will see that the graph is quite easy to use. @conveniences further enhance the way you create and manage nodes, making it easy to try different things.
