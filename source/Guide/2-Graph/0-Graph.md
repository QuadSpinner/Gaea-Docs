### Search

When you press `Tab` when the Graph surface is focused, or if you start typing while the context menu for the Graph is open, the Search feature will present itself. Search also shows up if you drag a connection from a port, but drop it in empty space, and then start typing when the node creation menu appears.

By default, it shows the last few nodes that were used. If you start typing, it will give you a list of nodes that match your search.

If you click a search result, the node will be created where your cursor is.

If a node is a selected, then you press `Tab`, and then press a shortcut, or click a node, the desired node will be created and connected (Primary Out to Primary In) to the selected node.

Shortcuts:
- `ENTER` creates the first (or selected) node.
- `Ctrl` + `1` through `9` create the subsequent.
