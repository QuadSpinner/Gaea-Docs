The handy Toolbox sits inside the graph, giving you quick drag-drop access to all nodes. You can use the shortcut `TAB` while in the graph to quickly access the search function, which appears as a popup next to your mouse cursor.

## Using the Toolbox
You can drag and drop a node from the toolbox to your Graph surface. If you drop it on a node, it will automatically connect itself to that node's output.

See @conveniences for more details on how to use the toolbox convenience features.

## Search Popup

Pressing `TAB` will show the Search popup. You can press `TAB` and start typing to get results. Pressing `Ctrl` + `1` through `9` will activate one of the first nine nodes in the search results.

You can also drag and drop a connection from a node's port into the empty area of the graph. This will trigger the node context menu. If you start typing, it will automatically go into search mode.

## Recent

Recently used nodes will show up separately in the Search popup if you clear the search text, giving you quicker access to frequently used nodes without having to explicitly set them as favorites.

The Recent nodes list is maintained per-session. It will be emptied when you exit Gaea.

## Favorites

Favorite nodes are shown at the top of the Graph. To add or remove a node from favorites, right-click on the tool in the Toolbox and check **Show in favorites**. Nodes marked as favorites appear a bit brighter than the other nodes.
