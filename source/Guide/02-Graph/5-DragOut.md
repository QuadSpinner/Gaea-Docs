title: Drag Out
---

"Drag out" is a shortcut feature in Gaea's @graph. To drag out, click down on a port on a node, drag a line and then release the mouse.

- If you drag out a line into an empty area, the create menu will show up.
- If you drag out a line to another port, it will try to connect the two ports.
- If you drag out a line and drop it in the middle of another node, the connection menu will appear.
