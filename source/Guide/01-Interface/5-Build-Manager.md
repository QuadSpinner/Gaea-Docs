## The Build Manager

The Build Manager gives you easy access to crucial output preferences. It is accessed by the **Build** tab in the sidebar.

#### Node List

The node list shows you all the nodes marked for export. You can temporarily toggle a node by clicking the checkbox next to the node. This does not affect the build, only the output. This can be useful when you just want to see a few specific outputs, or you need to go back to rebuild an older project for selective output.

When a node has multiple outputs, such as the Erosion and Breaker nodes in this example, you can individually toggle which ports should be saved as files.

#### Build Settings

You can define the output settings for your terrain. These settings are used for the Build process which will create the asset output from your graph. You can choose platform/game engine specific properties here.

#### Build Destination

You can choose the build folder and other options in this section. Build switches are available from the dropdown icon in the Build button. The Build button starts the final build process.

#### Terrain Definition

The Terrain Definition lets you choose the overall scale interpretation of the terrain - both overall size and altitude.

For more information on terrain scale and definition, see @scale.
