#### Getting Started

@installing contains instructions on installing Gaea.

If you are completely new to terrain design software, we recommend starting with the @first-terrain to familiarize yourself with the Gaea Interface in @getting-around.

The **Using Gaea** section explains various concepts in detail, such as using @primitives to build scenes, harnessing the power of @erosions to make realistic terrains, procedural @color-production, using the @buildmanager, and among many others.

#### For Advanced Users

The **Advanced Topics** section walks you through various terrain and workflow paradigms in Gaea.

Refer to the @reference to learn about individual nodes, their functions, and usage advice.
