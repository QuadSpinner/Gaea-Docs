# Welcome to the Gaea User Guide

The documentation is organized to help you get started with Gaea quickly and easily regardless of your skill level.

# Getting Started

@installing contains instructions on installing Gaea.

If you are completely new to terrain design software, we recommend starting with the @basics and familiarizing yourself with the Gaea Interface in @getting-around.

Gaea champions the idea of having **multiple workflows** to suit the artist and the terrain. You choose how you want to work. You can even change your workflow in the middle of the project without adverse effects. The **Workflows** section explains the main workflows in Gaea: @layers-mode, @graph-mode, @sculpt-mode

The **Using Gaea** section explains various concepts in detail; including the @build-manager, @color-production, @importing, and more.

Refer to the @reference to learn about individual nodes, their functions, and usage advice.
