Welcome to the Gaea User Guide. The documentation is organized to help you get started with Gaea quickly and easily regardless of your skill level.

## Getting Started

@installing contains instructions on installing Gaea.

If you are completely new to terrain design software, we recommend starting with the @first-terrain and familiarizing yourself with the Gaea Interface in @getting-around.

The **Using Gaea** section explains various concepts in detail: such as using @primitives to build scenes, harnessing the power of @erosions to make realistic terrains, procedural @color-production, and using the @buildmanager, among many others.

The **Concepts** section walks you through various terrain and workflow paradigms in Gaea.

Refer to the @reference to learn about individual nodes, their functions, and usage advice.
