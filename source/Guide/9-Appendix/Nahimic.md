title: Conflict with Nahimic
---

The "Nahimic" audio utility is installed with software bundles from manufacurers such as ASUS, MSI, etc. This audio tweaking application can aggressively interfere with non-game applications.

With Gaea, it can prevent the 3D viewport from launching successfully and force Gaea into a 2D-only view.

We highly recommend either excluding Gaea from this and other utilities that may inject code or interject themselves into Gaea's functionality, or disable/uninstall it completely.

Please look at the following resources for further information and details on uninstalling.
