## Node Notes

You can add notes to any node in the @graph to provide explanations, instructions, or ideas for future use. These notes can be helpful for yourself or others who may view the graph. They can also serve as a useful way to record ideas for future reference or for teaching others about the information represented in the graph.

To create a node, right-click a node select `Note`.

#### Note Editor

The Note Editor lets you write your note using either plain text or Markdown. Markdown is a simple way to format text that looks great on any device. It doesn’t do anything fancy like change the font size, color, or type — just the essentials, using keyboard symbols you already know.

You can use `*italics*`, `**bold**`, and more. See this [Markdown Reference](https://commonmark.org/help/) for the basics. Gaea only allows text-based markdow and does not allow functional items such as links.

The bottom portion of the dialog shows a live preview of the Markdown output of your note.

#### Displaying Notes

When a node with a note is selected, the bottom left corner of the Graph will show the formatted text.

Additionally, hovering over the node will show the same note in the tooltip.
