## Separating Concerns: An Important Guide for Complex Projects


#### Why do I need to separate my project?


#### Monolithic Construction vs. Distributed Processing

Construction (aka monolithic process) is about defining the general shapes and overall layout of the terrain.
Processing is about turning that rough shape into a realistic terrain.

The first process is where you focus on the larger shapes and not the details. then
eventually, the entire graph creating the core shapes funnels into one (or a few)
nodes that provide the final, rough shape.

The second process is where the shapes are processed through erosion, lookdev, and
other resolution-independent, worldspace friendly processes.
