Take any random shape like a @Perlin, and add an @Apex node. 

![](/images/tut/apex1.jpg){.w-100}

Switch the Apex node to Slant mode and adjust the A/B settings until you have a shape that looks pleasing to you. 

![](/images/tut/apex2.jpg){.w-100}

Duplicate the node and attach it to the Apex node. In the second node, change the Angle to 90 degrees.

![](/images/tut/apex3.jpg){.w-100}

Add a Displace node to the end to warp the shape a bit.

![](/images/tut/apex4.jpg){.w-100}

Experiment with different A/B settings and angles to get different permutations.
