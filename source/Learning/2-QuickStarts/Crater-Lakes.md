## Crater Lakes



![Crater: ](/images/quickstarts/Crater%20Lakes/f7be0e50-6d26-4fee-9dee-61d22da4c0e4.png)


We create a vast craterfield full of small and medium craters.

![Erosion: Random Sedimentation = 96.82%, Sediment Removal = 50.00%](/images/quickstarts/Crater%20Lakes/f6afdc97-4ea2-4a81-860c-549b77f1d13e.png)


Erosion with high Random Sedimentation and Sediment Removal help us create an erosive look while avoiding soil deposits.

Shear helps us break up the uniforimity by adding structural collapses everywhere.

![Lakes: Precipitation = 2.0](/images/quickstarts/Crater%20Lakes/ca126639-a01f-45da-bb38-93c26b44db01.png)


Small lakes are added using a low Precipitation value.
