## Volcano



![Crater: Profile = Impact Crater, Scale = 4.0, Depth = 2.0, Scale = 0.7, Height = 19.14%, Depth = 0.2, Inner Scale = 10.58%, Modulate = 0.4](/images/quickstarts/Volcano/f7be0e50-6d26-4fee-9dee-61d22da4c0e4.png)


A tall volcanic shape is created using the Impact Crater profile. Strong modulation and a small Inner Scale is the key to this look.

In Post Process, Autolevel is used to make the shape as tall as possible.

![Erosion: Duration = 11.74%, Random Sedimentation = 96.82%, Sediment Removal = 7.03%](/images/quickstarts/Volcano/f6afdc97-4ea2-4a81-860c-549b77f1d13e.png)


Erosion with a high Duration is used to refine the volcano. Random Sedimentation helps create non-uniform fluvial lines.

In Post Process, Clamp is used to reduce the height. We used Autolevel in the previous step to make Erosion stronger. Now we can remove that extra height.

![Erosion: Downcutting = 0.00%, Inhibition = 500.00%, Base Level = 500.00%, Sediment Removal = 22.01%, Area Effect = Precipitation Amount, Bias = 94.91%](/images/quickstarts/Volcano/ae1c9fd1-e7c9-4293-bed2-95cd8756a94b.png)


A second erosion pass, with settings that promote strong sedimentary flows is used to add the final touches.
