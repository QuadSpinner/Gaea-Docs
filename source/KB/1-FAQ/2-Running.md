### Do I need an internet connection to use Gaea?

Yes, for Community, Indie, and Professional editions you need an internet connection to activate the license, and at least once every 30 days to keep the license active.

The Enterprise edition can be both activated offline and not require an internet connection to stay activated.

### Is Gaea GPU powered?

Gaea uses the GPU primarily for visualizing data rather than processing it. Our algorithms are primed for CPU usage. While it may feel that may be a loss as modern GPUs can process heavy data, our algorithms can create elaborate effects not possible with current methods of GPU processing. Gaea's nodes are heavily multi-threaded and can use your CPU cores to the maximum as needed.

### Can I use Gaea on a Mac or Linux?

Gaea currently runs on Windows 7.1 or higher. Gaea will be available on Linux in the future. We don't have plans for a Mac version at this moment.

### Is Gaea standalone or a plugin?
