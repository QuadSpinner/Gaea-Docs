### How do I activate my license?

Download and install the Community Edition. You can load the license key on the Start Screen, About dialog, or the main menu in the primary window.

### How many computers can I install my Gaea license on?

Indie and Professional licenses can be used on two computers, such as a work PC and a personal laptop, as long as the same person uses it. 

Enterprise licenses can only be installed on one machine. For personal use, the user must acquire a separate license.

### Are Gaea licenses node-locked?

Yes, Indie and Professional edition licenses are node-locked. However you can deauthorize and move the license to a new machine without requiring intervention from our support team. There is no cost for reactivating a license once you exhaust your included moves. 

Enterprise editions are not node-locked and may be moved from machine to machine by deauthorizing an existing installation as frequently as needed.
