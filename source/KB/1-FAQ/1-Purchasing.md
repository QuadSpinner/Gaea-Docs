### Is Gaea subscription based?

### Do I need to pay a maintenance fee?

### How do I upgrade my Gaea license to Professional or Enterprise?

### Can I purchase Gaea with a credit card?

Yes. To pay using a credit card, instead of clicking the large "PayPal" button, press one of the card icons of your choice to open a popup window for that payment method.

If you are already in the popup window, do not log into your PayPal account. Instead, simply "Continue as a Guest" and you will see which credit cards PayPal accepts.

### There is a large X on my build! How can I remove that?

### Can I get a refund for my purchase?
