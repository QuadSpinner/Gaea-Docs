| Duration    | The number of erosion cycles to simulate. Usually 200 is sufficient.             |
| Power       | The strength of the erosion.                                                     |
| Granularity | Whether debris should be fine like dust, or coarse like rocks and even boulders. |
| BasLen      | The sub-simulation length of each particle.                                      |
| Radius      | The area affected by each particle.                                              |
| Random      | The randomness of each particle's motion.                                        |
| Seed        | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process.                        |
