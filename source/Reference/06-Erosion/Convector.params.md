| Iterations | Number of iterations of the convection process.                                                    |
| Steepness  | How much steepness to eradicate. Low values create sharper drops. High values create smooth flows. |
| Strength   | Strength of convection where sediments are bound together.                                         |
| Cutoff     | Altitude at which the effect is cut off.                                                           |
| Invert     | Invert slope angles.                                                                               |
| Add        | Add mass to rocks.                                                                                 |
| Remove     | Remove mass from rocks.                                                                            |
