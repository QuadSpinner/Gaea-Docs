| Setting                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Duration             | Determines the duration of erosion simulation. This parameter can be set to higher value than 1.0, but note that even default 0.04 (4%) is enough for most cases, resulting in prominent erosion effect. Low duration values, such as 0.02 and lesser, can be useful for adding erosion details while keeping the main original landscape features unchanged.                                                                    |
| Rock Softness        | Controls the softness of rock material. The softer rock is, the faster is erosion process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Strength             | Sets the strength of fluvial erosion. This parameter controls the sediment transport capacity, that is how much of dissolved minerals water can carry. This parameter can be set to value that is higher than 1.0, this can speed up the erosion process, but also can result in lesser erosion quality, especially if erosion softness value is high too.                                                                       |
|                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Downcutting          | This parameter controls the amount of downcutting, or vertical erosion. This is additional erosion mechanics, allowing water to transport sediments beyond the fluvial capacity by dragging and moving undissolved materials. This results in deeper gullies, and can be useful for getting mountain ranges.                                                                                                                     |
| Inhibition           | This parameter controls special mechanics, adding additional restraints for downcutting. It determines how undissolved sediments are slowed down by already dropped sediments, causing downcutting to stop and drop its load. This allows to combine both variants of erosion, with and without downcutting, resulting at deep channels at some areas and alluvial fans in other areas.                                          |
| Base Level           | Controls the base level for the vertical erosion process, this is the lowest elevation that downcutting process can erode until it stops and begins to drop sediment. This elevation is different across the whole terrain, and depends on the terrain slopes, relative altitudes, stream velocity and other factors. This parameter can be useful for filling the largest valleys with deposit material, forming valley floors. |

| Volume               | This is another special parameter, which alters erosion physics, treating water flows as volumetric objects, affecting each other, causing higher water levels during simulation, which results in wider channels, filled with more deposits. This is another way to get valley floor, and it works without downcutting.                                                                                                       |

For Slope, it is the steepness, for Altitude it the position from bottom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Reverse              | Reverse the bias direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Random Sedimentation | This parameter controls randomization of sedimentation process. In the cases of usual, uniform erosion it rarely has effect because multiple flows, dropping sediments randomly, results in uniform deposition field, thus cancelling random sedimentation effect. This parameter is for some non-standard scenarios, for example, masked precipitation, where precipitation occurs at some areas only.                          |

| Seed                 | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Aggressive Mode      | Process erosion faster at the risk of creating soft erosion artifacts in some minor areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
