Stratify allows you to create broken strata or rock layers on the terrain in a non-linear fashion. Unlike terracing, stratification involves substrata/subterraces created in confined local zones, such as between two broken plates. Each stratified layer exists independent from the rest of the layer, creating a robust, realistic formation.
