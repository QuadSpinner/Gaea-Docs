| **Duration**      | The number of breakage iterations to perform on the terrain. The default value should work in most situations. |
| **River Length**  | The maximum length of each break or river.                                                                     |
| **Erosion Power** | The strength of the breakage process. High values may cause sharp drops and spikes depending on the terrain.   |
| **Depth**         | Depth of the cracks.                                                                                           |
| **Seed**          | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process.                                                      |
| **Hard Cracks**   | Disables antialiasing and smooth of the crack edges.                                                           |
| **Mode**          |
|                   | *Fast* : Processes faster, but may not always result in the same pattern of cracks.                            |
|                   | *Accurate* : Processes a bit slower, but ensures the pattern remains the same.                                 |
