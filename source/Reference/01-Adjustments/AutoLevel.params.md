| Setting             | Description                                                                                                                                    |

| **Apply Autolevel** | Automatically levels the terrain where the heights are proportionately distributed between the highest and lowest points.                      |
| **Strength**        | The strength of the applied levels method.                                                                                                     |
| **Apply log**       | Applies logarithmic scaling to the terrain. It works similarly to Autolevel, but uses a logarithmic curve that bulks up the terrain much more. |
| **Inverse**         | Inverts the log curve.                                                                                                                         |
| **Log**             | The strength of the log curve.                                                                                                                 |
| **Apply Equalize**  | Equalizes the terrain where the heights are linearly distributed between the highest and lowest points.                                        |
| **Equalize**        | The strength of the equalization.                                                                                                              |
| **Apply Gamma**     | Applies a Gamma-style height adjustment to the terrain.                                                                                        |
| **Auto-Gamma**      | Applies AutoGamma.                                                                                                                             |
| **Gamma**           | The Gamma amount to be used. This only works when Auto-Gamma is turned off.                                                                    |
