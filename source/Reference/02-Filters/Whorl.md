uid: Whorl
title: Whorl
---

Whorl applies multiple vortex-like distortions across the terrain to create large scale warping. This can be very useful when creating massive landscapes and wanting to avoid a patterning in the noise, or for creating slightly surreal or alien landscapes.

{.TIP} 
> Whorl can be overpowering if used by itself. An effective way to tone down Whorl is to lower the Influence value in the Post Processing panel. See @Properties for details.
