| **Mode**      | Sets the processing method. The result can be dramatically different.                           |
|               | *Distance*: Creates an increasing slope from the "outline" of the shape towards its centerline. |
|               | *Slant*: Creates slopes like Distance but creates a steep slant as defined by the parameters.   |
| **Steepness** | Steepness of the slopes. (Distance only)                                                        |
| **A**         | Slant of the left slope. (Slant only)                                                           |
| **B**         | Slant of the right slope. (Slant only)                                                          |
| **Angle**     | Angle of the overall slant. (Slant only)                                                        |
