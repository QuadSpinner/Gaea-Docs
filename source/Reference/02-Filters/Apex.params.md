|               |          | *Distance*: Creates an increasing slope from the "outline" of the shape towards its centerline. |
|               |          | *Slant*: Creates slopes like Distance but creates a steep slant as defined by the parameters.   |
| **Steepness** | 0 - 100% | Steepness of the slopes. (Distance only)                                                        |
| **A**         | 0 - 100% | Slant of the left slope. (Slant only)                                                           |
| **B**         | 0 - 100% | Slant of the right slope. (Slant only)                                                          |
| **Angle**     | 0 - 360  | Angle of the overall slant. (Slant only)                                                        |
