| Setting         | Description                                                                                              |

| Impact       | The intensity of the process. Higher values create stronger physical impacts within the erosion process. |
| Impact Area  | The relative width of the areas impacted by the erosion.                                                 |
| Influence    | The influence or depth of the downcutting caused by the erosion.                                         |
| Downcutting  | The style of the downcutting in the erosion process.                                                     |
|                 | Destructive Tiny, small scale roughening of the entire surface with higher impact on steep slopes.     |
|                 | Pits Larger pit like impacts that overlap often, biased slightly towards existing flow structures.     |
|                 | Flows Deepen existing flow structures and create new minor ones.                                       |
|                 | Rivers Deepen existing flow structure in major river flow zones only.                                  |
