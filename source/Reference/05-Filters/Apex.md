Apex uses Euclidean distancing (the same function used to create the Voronoi pattern) to take any heightfield and turn it into a stark, pyramid-like mountain chain. It requires a terrain with a large difference between the highest and lowest points.

Applying @Warp after Apex - especially in Slant mode - can create very interesting effects.
