| Scale     | The scale of the overall field of shapes.                                |
| Steepness | The steepness of the slopes.                                             |
| Collision | Amount of collision between plates. Higher values create chaotic shapes. |
| Slant     | When enabled, adds a second slope to the edges.                          |
| Inverse   | Inverts all sloping operations to 180 degrees.                           |
| Seed      | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process.                |
