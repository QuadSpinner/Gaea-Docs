| **Precipitation** | The amount of rainfall that should occur in the precipitation simulation.                                                   |
| **Small Lakes**   | Favor or discourage smaller lake bodies. Allowing smaller lakes can be useful for creating swampy environments or puddles.  |
| **Flood Control** | Flood the terrain with a minimum amount of water, in addition to the Precipitation.                                         |
| **Water Floor**   | The altitude to which water is flooded with Flood Control. You can enter a precise height such as `500m` by right-clicking. |
| **Shore Size**    | The size of the shore surrounding all water bodies created by the node.                                                     |
| **Altitude Bias** | Bias the altitude of the shoreline.                                                                                         |
| **Size Bias**     | Bias the size of the shoreline.                                                                                             |
