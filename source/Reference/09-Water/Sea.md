Sea is a multi-function water surface generator and coastal erosion tool. Its primary purpose is to create a water surface, while Coastal Erosion creates beaches and cliffs.

The water surface can be generated either as global surface or filled from the edges without affecting inland features. In the latter mode, you can have custom control over which edges fill inward by using the `Edge` input mask.
