The Sediment node creates a thick layer of sedimentation on top of the terrain. The sediment is very generic and, based on your usage, can make sand or snow.

{.TIP} 
> The Drift mode creates an extremely large buildup of sedimentation (snow, sand, etc) offset to the main terrain. This can be great for creating snow buildup, glaciers, and more.

{.WARNING} 
> If the Drift looks too detached from the main terrain, try changing the Seed or lowering the Strength.
