The Output node gives you explicit options for saving a node's output to file. It is an alternative to the Mark for Export option that is available on all nodes. It is specifically useful for saving files to a predefined path and overwriting the output every time.

{.WARNING} 
> The output file will be overwritten on each build. Use the @build-manager instead to automatically stack and rename files.

{.NOTE}
> The Output node is for backward compatibility only. We recommend using the @build-manager instead, unless you have specific needs.
