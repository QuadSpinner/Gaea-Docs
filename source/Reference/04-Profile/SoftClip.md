SoftClip a low-level utility that lets you softly reduce the intensity of shapes above a specified threshold. It can be comparable to masking a shape with a @Height node and then clamping that portion. Unlike such a custom set up, the SoftClip node gives better results at a tremendously faster speed and requires no setup.
