Terrace (formerly called FractalTerraces) creates terraces or stratification of the terrain. The node is fractal in nature, and terracing is performed in multiple octaves giving you a very high level of detail.

You get detailed control over the edge shape, uniformity, rock hardness, and overall character of the terracing.
