ThermalShaper is a fast and effective way of condensing and coalescing shapes similar to what @Shaper does, but in a way where it is in line with what @Thermal Erosion does to a terrain.

You can use it to create smoother ridges, or even bulk up a terrain without creating bulbous shapes. ThermalShaper works very well with @Rivers.
