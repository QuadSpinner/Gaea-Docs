The Shaper node can bulk up, or bulk down, a terrain. Shaper is mainly created to add more "body" to landscape before eroding to avoid a `人` look after eroding. Usually, if you erode a `Λ` shape, you get `人` shape. If you apply Shaper, the pre-erosion shape becomes a `∩` shape, and after eroding it will be `Λ`, retaining the bulk in higher altitudes.
