title: Recurve

Recurve is a curvature-based expander node. It can inflate and/or deflate the terrain to create stronger slopes and larger, softer formations from a given noise or terrain.

{.TIP} 
> Despite appearances, Recurve's output is very sensitive to subtle changes in the source heightfield. For example, if prior to Recurve you apply MicroErosion or Breaker, then Recurve will create a very specific flow pattern on those grooves and valleys.
