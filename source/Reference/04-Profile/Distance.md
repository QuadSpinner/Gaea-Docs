Distance is a simple Distance Transform node that allows you to create a sloping shape from a flat shape. It is similar to the Distance mode in @Apex but far superior and efficient. It works very well in conjunction with nodes such as @Mask, @Island, @Abs, and anything else that produces hard, flat shapes.
