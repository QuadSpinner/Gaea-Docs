title: Displace

The Displace node distorts the input terrain using either built-in noises, or a custom input that you can provide. Displacement is a very useful way of adding perturbances and natural looking imperfections to terrains.



{.TIP} 
> If you need a bit of roughness on the terrain without altering the general shape, use Vertical displacement with lower scale and higher complexity.
