Insert is a utility node that lets you insert a sparse heightfield into another heightfield while preserving the target heightfield's relative heights. A common example is creating rocks on a flat (clipped) surface and then inserting them onto a terrain. Unlike Max or Add combines, Insert preserves the inserted heightfield and does not add artifacts or shapes from the underlying heightfield.
