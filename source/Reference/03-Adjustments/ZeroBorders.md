title: Zero Borders
---

The Zero Borders node allows you to softly transition the edges of a terrain into nothing. It is similar to a vignette effect in paint applications. This node is particularly useful when using @Bomber or other effects where the tall edge would be problematic.

{.TIP}
> If you are using Zero Borders to repeat the terrain shape, you may want to try the @Seamless node instead.
