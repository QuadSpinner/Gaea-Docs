| Strength                 | The strength of the Denoise operation. Higher values can take a very long time. Use cautiously.                                                       |
| Despeckle                | Despeckle cleans areas in which noise is noticeable, while leaving complex areas untouched. The noise is reduced without severely affecting contours. |
| Apply Enhancement        | When enabled, more aggressive denoising is applied.                                                                                                   |
| Target Stray Pixels Only | When enabled, it will only affect single pixel noise or residual artifacts from previous processes.                                       |
