The Crater primitive creates different types of crater shapes. As with all primitives, it is not meant to be the finished product, but rather a starting point from which to develop your own detailed shape.

Craters can be either volcanic, which start at the base and go up in a conical shape; or they can be impact craters, where the inside of the crater can be deeper than the base or ground around the crater.
