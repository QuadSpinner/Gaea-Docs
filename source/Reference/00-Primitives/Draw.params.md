| Setting              | Description                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Height**           | The height of the generated mountains. When Multiple Octaves is enabled, this setting determines the height of the tallest peak.                    |
| **Sprawl**           | The extent to which the mountains sprawl outwards from the drawing guides.                                                           |
| **Convexity**        | How convex the mountain shapes should be.                                                                                           |
| **Multiple Octaves** | When enabled, produces a multi-octave mountain chain that has several different heights and peaks. This also takes 2x the processing time. |
| **Scale**            | The scale of the octave noise.                                                                                                       |
| **Displacement**     | The amount of displacement added to the octave noise.                                                                                |
| **Erosion Power**    | The amount of pseudo-erosion added to the shape.                                                                                     |
| **Seed**             | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process.                                                                            |
