|          | Random : Creates equal variety of heights.              |
|          | Gaussian : Creates mostly high noise with fewer dips.   |
|          | Poisson : Similar to Guassian but with deeper dips.     |
|          | Impulse : Almost flat with few sharp dips.              |
|          | Uniform : Very flat with lots of low dips.              |
| Seed | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process. |
