The Resource node allows you to access any resource added to the project's Resource Manager.

If you are relying on an external library of files, it may be useful to add them to the @resource-manager and access them through the Resource node.

{.WARNING}
> Adding too large or too many resources to the project may slow down the project and create a large save size for the .tor.resources addon file. We recommend using it sparingly, and removing resources when they are no longer needed.
