The Resource node allows you to access any resource added to the project's Resource Manager.

If you are relying on an external library of files, it may be useful to add them to the @resource-manager and access them through the Resource node.

{.WARNING}
> Adding too many, or too large resources to the project may end up slowing the project and creating a large save size for the .tor.resources addon file. Recommend using it sparingly, and removing resources when they're no longer needed.
