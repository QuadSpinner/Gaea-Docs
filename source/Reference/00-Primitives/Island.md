The Island node lets you draw basic shapes from which entire landmasses can be generated.

To draw an Island, open the editor from the Properties panel and draw your basic island shape. It is best to create coarse, less-defined shapes and let the algorithm generate the details for you.

Once the general shape is ready, you can then use smaller brush sizes in both add and subtract mode to refine the coastlines.

> When refining the shape, keep your eye on the underlying generated shape instead of on your drawing. This will help you follow what changes.
