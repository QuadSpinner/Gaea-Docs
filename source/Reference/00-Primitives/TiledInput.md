uid: TiledInput
title: TiledInput
---

TiledInput lets you consume tile sets of images or heightfields, and use either for 1:1 tile processing or combine into a single image. This node allows you to bring in tile sets of worlds created elsewhere and you can use Gaea's processing on it in either a normal build or a tiled one. 


{.TIP}
> Gaea is optimized for faster builds when your input and output tile sizes are the same.
