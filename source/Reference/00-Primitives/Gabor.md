Gabor noise is one of the lesser used noises, but provides a wonderful pattern-friendly noise that can be used to simulate various aspects of nature.

Gabor shapes are dramatically different when compared to the common Perlin and Voronoi nodes. It can be used to create sand-like patterns, modulated hills, and more. Along with Perlin and Voronoi, we consider Gabor to be one of the foundation nodes of Gaea.
