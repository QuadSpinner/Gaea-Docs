SlopeNoise is a unique primitive specifically for creating expansive sloping terrains. SlopeNoise's internal noise distortions create a shape that is very conducive to strong, flowing erosion.

SlopeNoise is fantastic for medium range or close-up scenes, where you want to dramatically show the scale and height of the slope.
