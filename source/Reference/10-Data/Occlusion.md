The Occlusion node behaves similarly to Ambient Occlusion but favors sedimentary processes and rock crevices rather than lighting.

You can choose to focus on larger shapes such as gulleys and valleys over crevices by using a high power, or smaller crevices by using low values. This provides many opportunities to mask out areas for texturing separately.
