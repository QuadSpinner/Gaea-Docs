Sunlight is a Data Map that gives you the sunlight integral (sun light/shadow map) of any given period (up to 365 days). It can be used to drive snow melt, vegetation growth, and more. This node produces realistic results for any latitude in the world, so you can make it specific to any region your project relies on.
