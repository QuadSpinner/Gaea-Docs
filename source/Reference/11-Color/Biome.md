Biome uses a water map (like FlowMap or the Erosion node's Flow output) to create different biome zones based on altitude, access to fresh water (defined by the water map), and other conditions. The output from Biome can be used directly as a basic texture map, or as a "Super Splat". The colors for each biome zone (such as Desert, Tropical Rainforest, etc) can be customized to your needs.
