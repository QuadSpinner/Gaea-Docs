# Gaea Version History

You will find releases notes and download links for Gaea releases for both the `Production Ready` and `Bleeding Edge` branches.

You will also find a Patch download link for more recent versions. To use the Patch, you must be running the most immediate version before the Patch version, otherwise use the Full Installer instead.

Download links may not be available for older archived versions.

{.NOTE}
> Only the most recent updates (2019-present) are listed. If you need information for older builds, contact us.


## Branches

**Production Ready**

Production Ready builds are stable, and thoroughly tested both by the QA
team and regular users. They are released once or twice every month.

Bleeding Edge features are rolled into these builds slowly, once they
undergo thorough testing.


**Bleeding Edge**

Bleeding Edge builds are released once or several times a week. They are mostly stable, but not fully ready for production.

You get to try new features as they're added, and provide feedback very early so we can modify them to your satisfaction.

**INSTALL SIDE-BY-SIDE**

Both install to different locations, and do not share settings or registry entries. This
gives you the flexibility to try new features without endangering your work projects.

## Version Scheme

A version such as `1.0.30.5` is comprised of four elements `Major` `.` `Minor` `.` `Build` `.` `Revision`:

**Major**
Only changed when a new, payable version is released. This happens perhaps once every two years.

**Minor**
Updated when a major set of features are added. This usually happens a few times a year.

**Build**
Updated every time there is a new release in the `Production Ready` branch. This happens once or twice a month.

**Revision**
Updated every time a new build is released in the  `Bleeding Edge` channel. This can happen once, or sometimes several times, in a week.

Revision is incremented also when a Bleeding Edge build is rolled into the Production Ready branch.

{.NOTE}
> The *Revision* element was reset with the release of Gaea 1.0.28 to avoid confusion with the frequent Bleeding Edge updates.
