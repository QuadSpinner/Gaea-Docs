This build addresses several issues reported by users, as well as minor improvements.

## Hybrid Erosion Mode to be retired
The Hybrid process mode in the Erosion node will be retired in the near future. We have updated all our defaults and presets to use Linear mode instead, which is now comparably faster than ever.

With a few recent OpenCL driver issues in various hardware, Hybrid mode can potentially give faulty results in larger builds. If you are using Hybrid mode, you will get a soft warning in the Build Manager. We recommend migrating to the Linear mode when possible as this mode will become unavailable in the near future.

For maximum performance, we still recommend the Parallel process mode, which uses tiled processing and blending for fastest performance. However, it may create tile artifacts on certain slopes. If you encounter such tiling, please switch to Linear mode for maximum visual integrity.
