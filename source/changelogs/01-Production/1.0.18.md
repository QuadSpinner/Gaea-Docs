This version introduces two new heavy hitter nodes for creating color textures - **Texture and Vegetation**.

![Texture and Vegetation](http://cdn.quadspinner.com/gaea/changelog/1_0_18/texveg.jpg)

The **Texture** node creates sophisticated texture masks for coloration using CLUTer, SatMaps or other color nodes. You no longer need to combine multiple data maps to create a texture mask. At the same time, Texture's output can be combined with other data maps for detailed control.

The **Vegetation** nodes lets you add delicate foliage cover to any color texture map, freeing you from the need to include it in your main color gradient. This layering approach lets you create rich textures.


## Impact Craters

![Crater](http://cdn.quadspinner.com/gaea/changelog/1_0_18/crater.jpg)

The previous update added the new **Crater** node. However, its capabilities were limited as you pointed out. Based on the feedback, we have updated it with multiple profiles so you can have volcanic and impact craters. Additional profiles will be added in the future.

## SatMap Libraries

![Libraries](http://cdn.quadspinner.com/gaea/changelog/1_0_18/libraries.png)

The SatMaps node gets a v2 upgrade with Libraries. The satellite maps library is quite large with 1200+ maps, and a few hundred more scheduled to be added shortly. To help navigate them better, we have split the large collection into smaller, more meaningfully categorized Libraries.

## Presets for Erosion, Thermal, and Snow

![Presets](http://cdn.quadspinner.com/gaea/changelog/1_0_18/presets.png)

To help you realize the full potential of these powerful nodes, we have added 22 new presets. Presets for other nodes are going to be added in subsequent updates.

Preset options are now conveniently available in the Node Properties menu.

## New Installer

![NSIS Installer](http://cdn.quadspinner.com/gaea/changelog/1_0_18/nsis.png)

We have retired the MSI (Microsoft Installer) based setups for a more flexible installer. One of the main benefits of this installer is that it will work even without admin privileges.

If you choose to install without admin privileges, you should install to a non-protected folder.

NOTE: This installer will automatically try to uninstall the old MSI based installation.

We are also rolling out a new isolation mechanism with this new build and installer which will allow us to provide side-by-side installation capabilities with Production and Early Access builds in the near future.
