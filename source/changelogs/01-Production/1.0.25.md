## Selective Erosion

![](http://malachite.blob.core.windows.net/gaea/changelog/1_0_25/selective.jpg)

The Erosion node now features **Selective Processing** properties. When not using an Area mask, you can enable Area Effects based on slope or altitude bias. For example, a high slope bias with **Precipitation Amount** erodes slopes that are steep, while leaving the flat areas alone. This can create very interesting erosion shapes that are not possible with normal physical simulation.


## Build Mutations

![](http://malachite.blob.core.windows.net/gaea/changelog/1_0_25/mutations.png)

Now you can select up to 99 mutations in the Build Manager. This will run the build once per each mutation where seeds of all nodes are randomized, giving you a unique terrain in every mutation while still following the core recipe of your graph.

Each mutation's .tor file is stored with the output, so you can manually tweak a specific mutation if you wish to.


## CLUTer v2

![](http://malachite.blob.core.windows.net/gaea/changelog/1_0_25/HDgrad2.png)

We have redesigned CLUTer to be faster and more effective. Previously, you could not do much about banding artifacts that could show up on a low slope gradient. Now you can increase the Sample Density setting to smooth the gradient up to a factor of 8!


## Protrusion Data Map

![](http://malachite.blob.core.windows.net/gaea/changelog/1_0_25/protrusions.jpg)

The new Protrusion Data Map allows you to highlight protruding rock formations and sharp convexities in a broader form than with the Curvature node. It can be a useful layer in color production.



# Complete Changelog
