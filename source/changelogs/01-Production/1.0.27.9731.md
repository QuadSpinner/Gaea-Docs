<div class="release-note">

This build contains critical fixes for a number of key features. We recommend updating as soon as possible.

## Full 32-bit floating point compatibility

Following the less-than-satisfactory results from the previous builds. We have overhauled how we save 32-bit files such as OpenEXR and TIFF.

OpenEXR and TIFF are now joined with .r32 and .pfm formats as well.

See the [File Formats page](https://docs.quadspinner.com/Guide/Build/FileFormats.html) for details.

## New Scaling Options

To reduce confusion with the "Ignore vertical scaling" option, we are introducing the **Output Range** option.

You can now choose between Natural Elevation, Artificial Scaling, and Force Full Range.

The option "Natural Elevation" corresponds to "Ignore vertical scaling" being turned on, while "Artificial Scaling" corresponds to it being turned off.

See the [Building Terrains page](https://docs.quadspinner.com/Guide/Build/Building.html) for a detailed explanation.

## Shaper Node

The [Shaper node](https://docs.quadspinner.com/Reference/Adjustments/Shaper.html) can bulk up, or bulk down, a terrain. Shaper is mainly created to add more "body" to landscape before eroding to avoid a 人 look after eroding. Usually, if you erode a Λ shape, you get 人 shape. If you apply Shaper, the pre-erosion shape becomes a ∩ shape, and after eroding it will be Λ, retaining the bulk in higher altitudes.

Shaper can modify the body structure without losing fine details.

## Flux Markers

We brought the Flux markers from Helios and GeoGlyph into Gaea. When you move the slider, the last 3 positions are marked with little dots in decreasing opacity levels.

These handy little guides can be helpful when exploring settings.

## Revert Node, Save State

Unlike undo, which needs to be done per setting, the Revert node feature is a time saving facility added to all nodes. Whenever you select a node, the "state" of that node is saved to memory. If you change several settings and decide you want to go back to what you had, you can just go to the Node Properties menu and select "Revert Node". This will revert the node back to the saved state.

Be careful, when you select another node, the state of the previous node will be forgotten. But if you want to preserve the state for longer periods of time, you can manually select "Save State" in the same menu for any node. Now that node state is saved in memory until you close the file. You can go back and load the saved state anytime.

## Migrating to .NET Framework 4.8

Gaea is created, in part, on the Microsoft .NET Framework. Previous versions of Gaea have relied on .NET Framework 4.7. With this build, we are now using the latest 4.8 version. This will allow us to deliver better stability and improve Gaea's performance.

In most cases, this won't change anything for you. If you are running Windows 10 you probably already have .NET Framework 4.8 installed. If not, Gaea's installer will install it for you.

If you encounter any issues, please try installing it manually [from this direct link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/net48).
