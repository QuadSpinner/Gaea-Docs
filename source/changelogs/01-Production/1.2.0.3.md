# Complete Changelog

#### BREAKING CHANGES
- Some nodes may require upgrading to work properly.
- Light node will need to be recreated.
- All existing Erosion Studio projects will not work because of the complete overhaul.
- "Base" height, part of the terrain definition, has been removed. All terrains now start at 0m for easier consumption.
- Due to unavoidable changes in our randomizer some nodes - namely SlopeNoise, Noise, LineNoise, and Rocks - will no longer be able to create the same shape as in previous Gaea versions. If those shapes are crucial, please save them to file using the older Gaea version and use them in the new Gaea project as a file input.
