#### What's new in Gaea 1.2.1.8?

This is a patch for the previous release, 1.2.1.7, that fixes a few key issues.

For the major updates in 1.2 itself, see [the Gaea 1.2.1 blog post](https://blog.quadspinner.com/gaea-1-2-1/).

NOTE: If you are using the Houdini Bridge and are relying on .TOR file created before 1.2.1.5, we recommend opening the file in Gaea and letting it upgrade the nodes.
