This is a major build that introduces the Build Manager. Please see https://medium.com/quadspinner for details.

UPDATED

FIXES
- Filename would not change in the titlebar
- Water would toggle when toggling skybox
- Breaker optional output was inverted

- Several memory issues and other performance bug fixes

Known Issues
- The Erosion node may crash on certain PCs. Weâ€™re investigating this issue.
- Biome may show some unnecessary noise.
- SatMaps does not have a dedicated preview interface, yet. Expect it in the next build.
- Some elements in the startup screen are disabled by design. They will become active in the next build.
