KNOWN ISSUES
- The Erosion node can take a while at resolutions above 512 x 512.
- The Erosion node does not report progress yet, so it may seem “stuck”.
- The Erosion node may crash on certain PCs. We're investigating this issue.
- Some elements in the startup screen are disabled by design. They will become active in the next build.
- Due to structural changes in the file format, old files may not fully work with this new build.
