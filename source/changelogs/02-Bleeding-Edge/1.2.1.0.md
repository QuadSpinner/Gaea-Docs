#### What's new in Gaea 1.2.1.0?

While most of the focus has been on bug fixes and more stability, we've added a few new features like collapsible nodes, the new Fx node, and a pixel-based ZeroBorders mode for complete precision.

The way we work with portals and how we connect nodes has a whole new aspect with the new menus. See https://www.facebook.com/groups/QuadSpinnerGaea/permalink/634293150625636/

Further details forthcoming.
