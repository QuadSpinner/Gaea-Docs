# Gaea Release Notes

This section contains all previous Gaea versions, their release notes, and download links.

It is important to note when using an older build that it may have issues or bugs that may be fixed in newer builds. Unless you need to stay with a specific version for any reason, it is always recommended that you use the latest build available.

> [!NOTE]
> We archive older builds and they may not be available for download. If you require a specific version, contact us for a download link.
